Question: Sarah's journey on a distance-time graph shows her travel from point A to point B over a period of \( 5 \) minutes. 

If she maintains a speed of \( 12 \mathrm{~m} / \mathrm{s} \) during this time, what distance should be represented on the graph at the end of the \( 5 \) minutes? 

(Note: The graph has the vertical axis labelled Distance (m) with a star above the \( 0 \) mark and the horizontal axis is labelled Time (mins) going from \( 0 \) to \( 5 \) in even intervals.)

### 
Answers:
(A) - \( 3600 \mathrm{~m} \) 

(B) - \( 600 \mathrm{~m} \) 

(C) - \( 60 \mathrm{~m} \) 

(D) - \( 720 \mathrm{~m} \) 

### 
Misconceptions:
(A) - Incorrectly multiplies speed by the full duration in seconds without converting minutes. 

(B) - Correctly calculates distance but fails to account for the total travel time in seconds. 

(C) - Misunderstands the relationship between distance, speed, and time leading to an incorrect formula. 

(D) - nan
