Question: Given the equation 
\[
y = 4x + 2
\] complete the table of values:

\begin{tabular}{|l|l|}
\hline \( x \) & \(\bigstar\) \\
\hline \( y \) & \( 10 \) \\
\hline
\end{tabular} What value should replace the star? 

###
Answers:
(A) - \( 2 \) 

(B) - \( 3 \) 

(C) - \( \frac{8}{4} \) 

(D) - \( 1 \) 

###
Misconceptions:
(A) - Believes that every time y is positive, x must also be positive and doesn't apply the equation correctly. 

(B) - Correctly calculates but misunderstands how to balance the equation to find x from y. 

(C) - Thinks that division of the constant by the coefficient gives the correct x value instead of focusing on the total value of y. 

(D) - Believes that y can be found without substituting x values into the equation.
