Question: A pattern of squares is evolving. The first term has \( 4 \) squares, the second term has \( 8 \), and the third term has \( 12 \). How many squares will be in the \( 6 \) th term of this sequence? 

###
Answers:
(A) - \( 20 \) 

(B) - \( 24 \) 

(C) - \( 22 \) 

(D) - \( 18 \) 

###
Misconceptions:
(A) - Misunderstands the pattern's progression and calculates incorrectly 

(B) - Predicts based on the last term instead of observing the sequence's incremental change 

(C) - Incorrectly assumes a varying increment rather than a consistent one 

(D) - When asked for a term several steps ahead incorrectly reduces the sequence

Subject: Linear Sequences (nth term)
###
ConstructName: Use a linear sequence expressed as a pattern to make a prediction about another term in the sequence other than the next one
###
CorrectAnswer: B
