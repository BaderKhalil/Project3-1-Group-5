Question: These two triangles are similar.

What is the value of \( x \) ? ![The diagram is of two triangles. The smaller triangle has a base of 30cm and height labelled \( x \). The larger triangle has a base of 75cm and height 50cm.]() 

###
Answers:
(A) - \( 20 \mathrm{~cm} \) 

(B) - \( 15 \mathrm{~cm} \) 

(C) - \( 25 \mathrm{~cm} \) 

(D) - \( 30 \mathrm{~cm} \) 

###
Misconceptions:
(A) - Misunderstanding the ratio of similarity and calculating incorrectly based on the perimeter instead of height. 

(B) - Confusing the relationship between the lengths of corresponding heights with the length of bases. 

(C) - Misapplying the scale factor resulting in an incorrect estimation. 

(D) - Incorrectly assuming that the heights are equal due to misinterpretation of proportion.
