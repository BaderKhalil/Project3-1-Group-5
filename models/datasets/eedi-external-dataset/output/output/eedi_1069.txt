Question: A two-step function machine takes an input \( x \) and first doubles it, then adds 3. What is the output when the input is \( 4 \)? 

Andy says the output is \( \mathbf{2} \boldsymbol{x} + \mathbf{3} \)

Sara says the output is \( \mathbf{3} + \mathbf{2} \boldsymbol{x} \)

Who is correct?
