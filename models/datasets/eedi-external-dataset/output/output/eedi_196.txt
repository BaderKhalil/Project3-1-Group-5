Question: Rearrange the following equation to make \( x \) the subject
\( 3x - 4y = 12 \)

###
Answers:
(A) - \( x=\frac{12 + 4y}{3} \)

(B) - \( x=12 - 4y \div 3 \)

(C) - \( x=\frac{12 + 4y}{3} \)

(D) - \( x=\frac{12 + 4y}{3} \)

###
Misconceptions:
(A) - Confuses the inverse operations of addition and subtraction when rearranging equations 

(B) - Misunderstands order of operations in algebraic expressions 

(C) - Confuses the addition of terms which leads to an incorrect calculation of \( x \)

(D) - Confuses the algebraic structure, misplacing the negative sign during operations
