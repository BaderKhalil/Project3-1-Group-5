Answers:
(A) - \( 0.12 \) 

(B) - \( 0.2 \) 

(C) - \( 0.18 \)

###
Misconceptions:
(A) - Confuses division with multiplication, calculating \( 0.6 \times 0.2 \) instead of dividing. 

(B) - Incorrectly scales the answer down without properly dividing, thinking \( 0.6 \div 3 \) reduces to \( 0.2 \).

(C) - Incorrect estimation leads to an assumption \( 0.6 \) divided by \( 3 \) is approximately \( 0.18 \) based on rounding or miscalculating.
