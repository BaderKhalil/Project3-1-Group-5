Question: Lisa is trying to calculate the distance between these two points: \( (3, -4) \) and \( (-2, 2) \). She labels them like this: \( \begin{array}{cccc}x_{1} & y_{1} & x_{2} & y_{2} \\ (3, & -4) & (-2, & 2)\end{array} \) Then she uses the formula \( \sqrt{\left(x_{2}-x_{1}\right)^{2}+\left(y_{2}-y_{1}\right)^{2}} \). What does the first bracket equal?

###
Answers:
(A) - \( (-5)^{2} \) 

(B) - \( (5)^{2} \) 

(C) - \( (7)^{2} \) 

(D) - \( (-1)^{2} \) 

###
Misconceptions:
(A) - Incorrectly determines the result of \( (-2) - (3) \) without recognizing it results in a negative value. 

(B) - Incorrectly assumes that the subtraction results in a positive difference. 

(C) - Misunderstands how to apply the subtraction operation, believing the values can be combined without regard to their signs. 

(D) - Incorrectly calculates the result of the subtraction as if both coordinates are positive.
