Question: Lisa claims that the expression \( 3n - 4 \) represents a linear sequence, while Mark argues that \( n^2 - n \) also produces a linear sequence. Who is correct? 

###
Answers:
(A) - Only Lisa

(B) - Only Mark

(C) - Both Lisa and Mark

(D) - Neither is correct

###
Misconceptions:
(A) - Recognizes that the first expression is linear but does not understand that the second expression is quadratic 

(B) - Believes all polynomial expressions produce linear sequences without considering the degree of the polynomial 

(C) - Does not recognize the difference between linear and non-linear sequences 

(D) - Believes that a linear sequence cannot involve multiple types of expressions
