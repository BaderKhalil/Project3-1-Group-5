Question: Sarah and Liam are analyzing two lines on a coordinate plane. Sarah claims these two lines are parallel ![Image of a grid with two lines drawn. One line extends with a slope of 3 (rise 3, run 1), while the second line goes with a slope of 3 as well.]() Liam argues that these two lines are parallel ![Image of a grid with two lines. One line has a steep slope of 2 (rise 2, run 1) and the other line has a negative slope of -2 (rise -2, run 1).]() Who is correct?
