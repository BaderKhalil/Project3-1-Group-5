Question: Rearrange the following equation to make \( x \) the subject \( A = \frac{1}{2} b h x \)

###
Answers:
(A) - \( x = \frac{A}{b h} \)

(B) - \( x = A \cdot \frac{2}{b h} \)

(C) - \( x = 2 \cdot \frac{A}{b h} \)

(D) - \( x = \frac{b h}{2A} \)

###
Misconceptions:
(A) - nan 

(B) - Misunderstands the relationship between multiplication and division, incorrectly scales by \( 2 \) instead of simplifying. 

(C) - Incorrectly applies a multiplication factor instead of isolating the variable correctly. 

(D) - Confuses the operation by reversing the order of variables and operations incorrectly.
