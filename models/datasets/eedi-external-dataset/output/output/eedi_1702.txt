Question: For the equation
\[
5x + 2y = 20
\] the following table of values is provided:
\begin{tabular}{|l|l|}
\hline \( x \) & \( \bigstar \) \\
\hline \( y \) & \( 5 \) \\
\hline
\end{tabular} What value should replace the star? 

###
Answers:
(A) - \( 2 \) 

(B) - \( 5 \) 

(C) - \( 6 \) 

(D) - \( 8 \) 

###
Misconceptions:
(A) - Thinks that any positive number can solve the equation without performing calculations to find the specific value. 

(B) - Incorrectly assumes the given \( y \) value can be \( x \) value as well without considering the relationship defined by the equation. 

(C) - Miscalculates by treating the equation as if the addition or subtraction can be ignored when solving for \( x \).

(D) - Treats the equation incorrectly by assuming a linear behavior between \( x \) and \( y \) without considering the coefficients in the equation.
