Question: A recipe calls for ingredients to be mixed in the ratio \( 2: 3 \). If you use \( _____ \) times as much of the second ingredient as the first ingredient, how many times more is the second ingredient used compared to the first?

###
Answers:
(A) - \( 3 \)

(B) - \( 5 \)

(C) - \( 1 \)

(D) - \( 2 \)

###
Misconceptions:
(A) - nan 

(B) - Misunderstands that in a ratio a larger number does not mean it is that many times larger in parts but rather a part of the total mixture.

(C) - nan 

(D) - Confuses the parts of the ratio by not recognizing that the second ingredient is actually \( 1.5 \) times larger than the first, hence \( 2 \) is incorrect.
