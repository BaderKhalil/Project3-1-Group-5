Question: Jenny, Mark, and Lisa are trying to determine the area of a garden that is shaped like a T. Who found the correct area? ![A T-shaped figure where the width at the top is 8m, the height of the vertical part is 12m, and the width of the vertical part at the bottom is 4m.]() 

###
Answers:
(A) - Jenny: \( 8 \times 4 + 4 \times 12 \)

(B) - Mark: \( 8 \times 12 - 4 \times 8 \)

(C) - Lisa: \( 8 \times 12 + 4 \times 4 \)

(D) - They are all correct 

###
Misconceptions:
(A) - Misidentifies the dimensions when adding the areas of different sections.

(B) - Misunderstands how to apply the area formulas correctly for composite shapes and subtracts incorrectly.

(C) - Confuses the area calculation by incorrectly adding dimensions for a composite area rather than correctly applying it.

(D) - Believes that all calculations must yield correct results when they do not.
