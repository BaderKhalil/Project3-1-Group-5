Question: \(
y_{n+1}=5+\frac{2}{y_{n}}
\)

Using a starting value of \( y_{1}=3 \), what is the solution to \( y=5+\frac{2}{y} \) to \( 2 \) decimal places? 

###
Answers:
(A) - \( 6.33 \) 

(B) - \( 6.25 \) 

(C) - \( 6.32 \) 

(D) - \( 6.3 \) 

###
Misconceptions:
(A) - Miscalculates the iteration, resulting in an overestimate.

(B) - Incorrectly assumes that the first iteration yields the final answer without further refinement.

(C) - nan 

(D) - Rounds to the wrong degree of accuracy (oversimplified decimal representation).
