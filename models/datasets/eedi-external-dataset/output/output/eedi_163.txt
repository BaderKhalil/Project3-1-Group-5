Question: When factorising \( x^{2}-4x-5 \) we need two numbers that: 

###
Answers:
(A) - Add to give \( -4 \) and multiply to give \( -5 \) 

(B) - Add to give \( -4x \) and multiply to give \( -5 \) 

(C) - Add to give \( -5 \) and multiply to give \( -4 \) 

(D) - Add to give \( -5x \) and multiply to give \( -4 \) 

###
Misconceptions:
(A) - Does not know that to factorise a quadratic expression, to find two numbers that add to give the coefficient of the x term, and multiply to give the non variable term 

(B) - Does not understand that the addition is about the constant term and not the form of the variable 

(C) - Does not know that to factorise a quadratic expression, to find two numbers that add to give the coefficient of the x term, and multiply to give the non variable term 

(D) - Does not know that to factorise a quadratic expression, to find two numbers that add to give the coefficient of the x term, and multiply to give the non variable term
