Question: ![A function machine with 3 rectangles in a row, joined by arrows pointing from left to right. The first rectangle on the left is empty and says "input" above it. The middle rectangle has "Multiply by 3" written inside it and the final rectangle has "output" written above it and "21" written inside it.]() What is the input of this function machine? 

###
Answers:
(A) - \( 63 \) 

(B) - \( 7 \) 

(C) - \( 18 \) 

(D) - \( 3 \) 

###
Misconceptions:
(A) - Believes the inverse of multiplying by 3 is multiplying by a larger number. 

(B) - Correctly identifies the input as the result of the inverse operation. 

(C) - Thinks that to find the input, one simply subtracts a number from the output instead of dividing by 3. 

(D) - (Considers a number that is too small and doesn't account for the operation applied)
