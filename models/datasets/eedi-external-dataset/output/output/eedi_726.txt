Question: What is the perimeter of a composite shape formed by two rectangles with dimensions 10 cm, 4 cm, and 6 cm? ![Composite shape with dimensions labelled]()

###
Answers:
(A) - \( 64 \mathrm{~cm} \)

(B) - \( 46 \mathrm{~cm} \)

(C) - \( 38 \mathrm{~cm} \)

(D) - \( 48 \mathrm{~cm} \)

###
Misconceptions:
(A) - Calculates all inner and outer sides appropriately for perimeter 

(B) - Incorrectly omits lengths of some sides of the rectangles when calculating total perimeter 

(C) - Calculates perimeter of individual rectangles but fails to consider the composite nature of the shape 

(D) - Mistakes the dimensions as being additive instead of taking into account overlapping sides
