Question: Jamie is using blocks to solve an equation. Which of these is the correct way to begin solving it? ![Three diagrams of equations shown with blocks. Step 1 is three blocks plus two equals two blocks plus five. Step 2 is two equals five minus three blocks. Step 3 is three blocks equals three.]() 

###
Answers:
(A) - \( \begin{array}{c}3x+2=2x+5 \\ x=3\end{array} \)

(B) - \( 2x=3 \)

(C) - \( \begin{array}{c}3x+2=2x+5 \\ 2x=5\end{array} \)

(D) - \( \begin{array}{c}3x+2=2x+5 \\ x=1\end{array} \)

###
