Question: A velocity-time graph depicts the motion of a cyclist during a trip ![A velocity-time graph. Section A goes from (0,0) to (10,15). With the 10 being 10 seconds and the 15 being 15 m/s.]() What was the distance travelled during section A? 

###
Answers:
(A) - \( 75 \mathrm{~m} \) 

(B) - \( 150 \mathrm{~m} \) 

(C) - \( 50 \mathrm{~m} \) 

(D) - \( 30 \mathrm{~m} \) 

###
Misconceptions:
(A) - Assumes the calculation is simply length times time without considering the right method to find area. 

(B) - Thinks the area under the graph represents a larger distance without performing the correct area calculation. 

(C) - Believes that distance equals speed multiplied by time without understanding that itâ€™s based on the area under the graph.

(D) - Confuses the dimensions of the graph and thinks the area calculation might underrepresent the actual distance.
