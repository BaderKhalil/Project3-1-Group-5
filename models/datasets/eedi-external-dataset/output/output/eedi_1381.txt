Question: If \( v = u + at \) What is the value of \( v \) when
\[\begin{array}{l} a=2 \\ u=10 \\ t=3 \end{array}\]

###
Answers:
(A) - \( 16 \) 

(B) - \( 20 \) 

(C) - \( 6 \) 

(D) - \( 8 \) 

###
Misconceptions:
(A) - Miscalculates the expression by using a subtraction instead of addition 

(B) - Correctly applies the formula but mistakenly adds an incorrect value for \( a \) 

(C) - Wrongly assumes that multiplying acceleration and time gives the final velocity directly without adding initial velocity 

(D) - Incorrectly substitutes the values into the equation, leading to a wrong calculation 

###
