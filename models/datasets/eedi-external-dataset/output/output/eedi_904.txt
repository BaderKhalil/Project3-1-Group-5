Question: What is the size of the marked angle? ![A 360 degree protractor with 2 blue lines and a yellow sector marking out an angle being measured by the protractor. The inner scale goes from 0 to 360 clockwise. The angle is an acute angle that is between the blue line that is at 30 (inner scale) and 90 (outer scale) on the protractor, clockwise to the blue line that is halfway between 40 and 50 (inner scale) and halfway between 70 and 80 (outer scale).

Answers:
(A) - \( 45^{\circ} \) 

(B) - \( 60^{\circ} \) 

(C) - \( 75^{\circ} \) 

(D) - \( 30^{\circ} \) 

###
Misconceptions:
(A) - Correct scale but misidentifies the angle type as obtuse 

(B) - Positive with the correct range, but misreads the angle position 

(C) - Correct range but miscalculates the included angle 

(D) - Reads the angle at the starting point rather than the vertex
