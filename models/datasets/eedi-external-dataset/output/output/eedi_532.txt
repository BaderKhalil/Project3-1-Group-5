Question: Here are \( 3 \) corners of a triangle: 
\((1,2),(4,5),(1,5),\)

What are the coordinates of the \( 4^{\text {th }} \) vertex?

###
Answers:
(A) - \( (4,2) \)

(B) - \( (1,1) \)

(C) - \( (3,3) \)

(D) - \( (2,5) \)

###
Misconceptions:
(A) - Believes that the triangle must have one right angle and therefore doesn't understand the arrangement of vertices.

(B) - Believes that the triangleâ€™s height must be aligned with the vertex's y-coordinates, thereby misplacing the vertex.

(C) - nan

(D) - Believes that triangles can only have horizontal or vertical sides, incorrectly placing the vertex.
