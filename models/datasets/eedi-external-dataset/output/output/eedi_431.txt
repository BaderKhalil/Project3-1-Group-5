Question: This is a conversion graph between gallons and litres. Which of the following is the best estimate for the number of gallons equivalent to \( 100 \) litres? ![A graph on gridded paper showing litres on the y axis from 0 to 100 and gallons on the x axis from 0 to 30. A straight line goes from the origin and passes through (45,80) (not marked - just a point it goes through) but extends the whole way up the graph.]() 

###
Answers:
(A) - \( 26 \) gallons 

(B) - \( 15 \) gallons 

(C) - \( 23 \) gallons 

(D) - \( 30 \) gallons 

###
Misconceptions:
(A) - When reading graph, chooses value close to marked point without considering actual line. 

(B) - Reads values thinking gallons are significantly less than litres and overestimates difference. 

(C) - Correctly approximates but misreads what point corresponds to 100 litres. 

(D) - Assumes maximum value indicated on graph represents the equivalent without checking the specific conversion scale.
