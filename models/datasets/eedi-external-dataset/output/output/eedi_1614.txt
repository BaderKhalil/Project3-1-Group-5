Question: Which of the following sketches could represent \( y = -3x + 2 ? \) 

###
Answers:
(A) - ![2 axes showing a negative gradient, crossing the y-axis at a positive number]() 

(B) - ![2 axes showing a negative gradient with a negative y intercept]() 

(C) - ![2 axes showing a positive gradient, crossing the y-axis at a positive number]() 

(D) - ![2 axes with a negative gradient and a positive y intercept]() 

###
Misconceptions:
(A) - Believes that a negative coefficient for x indicates a positive slope, misinterpreting the meaning of the slope in the equation. 

(B) - Confuses y-intercept interpretation, thinks it can never be positive with a negative slope. 

(C) - Misunderstands the relationship between the coefficient of x and the slope, associating positive slopes with any equations. 

(D) - Misinterprets how negative slopes can still start from a positive y-intercept, leading to faulty conclusions about the lineâ€™s behavior.
