Question: Factorise fully \( 24b - 16 \)

###
Answers:
(A) - \( 8(3b - 2) \)

(B) - \( 16(1.5b - 1) \)

(C) - \( 4(6b - 4) \)

(D) - \( 12(2b - 1) \)

###
Misconceptions:
(A) - Is correct, but believes that the factorisation is complete when it is actually possible to simplify further.

(B) - Misunderstands that multiplying numbers can lead to decimals, leading to an incorrect conversion.

(C) - Uses a common factor that is not the highest common factor (HCF) which means it doesnâ€™t fully factorise the expression.

(D) - Incorrectly assumes that the expression can be factored by taking out a number without finding the actual common factor, leading to incorrect terms in the bracket.
