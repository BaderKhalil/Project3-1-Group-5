###
Question: \( v = u + at \) What is the value of \( v \) when 
u = 5 
a = 2 
t = 3 

###
Answers:
(A) - \( 11 \) 

(B) - \( 20 \) 

(C) - \( 25 \) 

(D) - \( 6 \) 

###
Misconceptions:
(A) - nan 

(B) - Miscalculates by applying the multiplication incorrectly and adding extra terms. 

(C) - Misunderstands the operation order, thinking that adding the velocity and acceleration gives a greater value. 

(D) - Incorrectly assumes that \( v \) is simply \( u \) without considering the effects of acceleration and time.
