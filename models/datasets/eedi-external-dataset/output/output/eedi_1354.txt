Question: Which function machine will solve the equation \( 3x - 7 = 8 ? \) 

###
Answers:
(A) - ![A function machine showing x as the input then multiplying by 3, then -7 to yield 8 as the output. Then a reverse function machine showing 8 as the input, first adding 7 then dividing by 3]() 

(B) - ![A function machine showing 8 as the input, first adding 7 then multiplying by 3 to give the output]() 

(C) - ![A function machine showing x as the input, first adding 7 then dividing by 3 to yield 8 as the output. Then a reverse function machine underneath showing 8 as the output now as the input, multiplying by 3 then -7]() 

(D) - ![A function machine showing x as the input then -7 then multiplying by 3 to give 8 as the output. Then a reverse function machine showing 8 as the output input, subtracting 3 before adding 7]() 

###
Misconceptions:
(A) - Follows the correct operations, but the order of applying the inverse operations is incorrect. 

(B) - Uses the same operations rather than the inverse when attempting to solve the equation. 

(C) - nan 

(D) - Mistakenly applies subtraction before addition, and does not accurately represent the operations needed to solve the equation.
