Question: What are the values of \( a \) and \( b \) in the area formula for this trapezoid? ![Diagram of a trapezoid with its two parallel sides labeled as 5m and 12m. The lengths of the two non-parallel sides are not specified, and the perpendicular height is labeled as 4m.]() Area \( =\left(\frac{a+b}{2}\right) h \)

###
Answers:
(A) - \( 5+12 \)

(B) - \( 4+12 \)

(C) - \( 5+4 \)

(D) - \( 5+5 \)

###
Misconceptions:
(A) - nan

(B) - Mistakes height for one of the parallel sides to find area of a trapezoid

(C) - Uses height instead of parallel sides to find area of a trapezoid

(D) - Uses incorrect values for the parallel sides which are not reflective of the trapezoid's dimensions
