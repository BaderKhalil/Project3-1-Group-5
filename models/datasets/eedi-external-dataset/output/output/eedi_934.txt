Question: \begin{tabular}{|l|l|l|l|l|l|}
\hline\( x \) & \( 0 \) & \( 1 \) & \( 2 \) & \( 3 \) & \( 4 \) \\
\hline\( y \) & \( \color{gold}\bigstar \) &   
\end{tabular} This is a table of values for \( 3x - y = 6 \) 
What should replace the star? 

###
Answers:
(A) - \( 3 \) 

(B) - \( 0 \) 

(C) - \( -3 \) 

(D) - \( 6 \) 

###
Misconceptions:
(A) - Assumes that adding constants to solve for y is the correct approach without isolating y. 

(B) - Believes that if x is 0, y must also be 0 in the context of equations. 

(C) - Misinterprets the manipulation of signs when solving for y, leading to an incorrect negative value. 

(D) - Calculates the value of y without considering the influence of the given x value on the original equation.
