Question: Here are the first \( 5 \) terms of a linear sequence. The first term is represented by 2 dots, the second term has 4 dots, the third term has 6 dots, the fourth term has 8 dots, and the fifth term has 10 dots. How many dots would be in the \( 12^{\text {th }} \) term?

###
Answers:
(A) - \( 22 \) 

(B) - \( 20 \) 

(C) - \( 18 \) 

(D) - \( 24 \) 

###
Misconceptions:
(A) - Thinks the difference between terms is not consistent. 

(B) - Thinks the sequence is increasing by \( 2 \) each time but miscalculates. 

(C) - Thinks the sequence only grows to a certain point and then stops.

(D) - Thinks the sequence continues to grow beyond the established pattern.
