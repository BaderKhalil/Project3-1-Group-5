Question: Simplify the following expression: \( \frac{2x^{2} - 8}{4x - 16} \)

###
Answers:
(A) - \( \frac{x - 4}{2} \)

(B) - \( \frac{x + 4}{2} \)

(C) - \( \frac{2(x - 4)}{4(x - 4)} \)

(D) - \( 2 \)

###
Misconceptions:
(A) - Thinks that simplification can only occur by dividing by a constant factor instead of recognizing common factors in expressions.

(B) - Believes that the expression simplifies to add constants in the numerator rather than factorising correctly.

(C) - Assumes that factors in the numerator and denominator cancel completely, forgetting about the remaining factors.

(D) - Misunderstands that directly equating the expression to a constant without simplification is valid.
