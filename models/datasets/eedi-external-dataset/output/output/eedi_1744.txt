Question: Calculate the first \( 2 \) terms in the sequence defined by the \( n \)th term \( 3 n^{2} - n + 2 \).

###
Answers:
(A) - \( 2, 11 \) 

(B) - \( 5, 14 \) 

(C) - \( 8, 23 \) 

(D) - \( 2, 8 \) 

###
Misconceptions:
(A) - Incorrectly adds the terms instead of evaluating the function at the given \( n \) values.

(B) - Miscalculates the quadratic term and fails to account for the linear and constant components correctly.

(C) - Fails to correctly substitute values for \( n \) leading to incorrect numbers; could misinterpret the operations on quadratic terms.

(D) - Correctly evaluates the function but misunderstands that the original question asks for the first two terms, resulting in confusion about the sequence generation.
