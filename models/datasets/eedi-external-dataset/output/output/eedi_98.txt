Question: This is a graph of
\(y=2x+1\) ![A set of axes with the graph y=2x+1 drawn on.]() Use the graph to solve
\(2x+1=5\) 

###
Answers:
(A) - \(x=1\) 

(B) - \(x=2\) 

(C) - \(x=0\) 

(D) - \(x=3\) 

###
Misconceptions:
(A) - Believes the solution to the equation is simply obtained by setting \(y=1\).

(B) - Miscalculates the equation by incorrectly simplifying \(2x=5-1\) to \(2x=6\).

(C) - Incorrectly thinks that if \(2x + 1 = 5\), then \(x\) must be \(0\) because the constant term is \(1\).

(D) - Believes to reach the solution, one can overestimate the number of additions or multiplications necessary.
