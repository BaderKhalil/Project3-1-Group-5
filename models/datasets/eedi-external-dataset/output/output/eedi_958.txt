Question: Sarah claims that \( 2^{6} = 4^{3} \) because \( 4 = 2^{2} \). Mark disagrees and says \( 2^{6} \) simplifies to \( 64 \) which cannot be equal to \( 4^{3} \).

###
Answers:
(A) - Only Sarah

(B) - Only Mark

(C) - Both Sarah and Mark 

(D) - Neither is correct 

###
Misconceptions:
(A) - Thinks that \( 4^{3} \) can be correctly rewritten using the base \( 2 \) without calculating the actual value.

(B) - Incorrectly assumes the two values must be treated as completely different without recognizing that they can be expressed using the same base.

(C) - Believes that equalities must be evaluated exclusively by numeric values rather than understanding base representations. 

(D) - Thinks both representations were mistakenly calculated and cannot be equal for any value.
