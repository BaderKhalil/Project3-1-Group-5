Question: Maria is measuring the temperature of water over time as it heats up on a stove.

At \( 5 \) minutes, the water temperature is \( 60 \) degrees Celsius.

Where on the graph should Maria plot this point?

###
Answers:
(A) - ![A graph with time (minutes) on the horizontal axis and temperature (째C) on the vertical axis. A is plotted above 5 on the horizontal axis and right of 60 on the vertical axis.]() 

(B) - ![A graph with time (minutes) on the horizontal axis and temperature (째C) on the vertical axis. B is plotted above 60 on the horizontal axis and right of 5 on the vertical axis.]() 

(C) - ![A graph with time (minutes) on the horizontal axis and temperature (째C) on the vertical axis. C is plotted below 60 on the horizontal axis and right of -5 on the vertical axis.]() 

(D) - ![A graph with time (minutes) on the horizontal axis and temperature (째C) on the vertical axis. D is plotted below 5 on the horizontal axis and left of 60 on the vertical axis.]()

Misconceptions:
(A) - nan 

(B) - When reading value from graph, reads from the wrong axes. 

(C) - When reading value from graph, misinterprets direction of values on axes. 

(D) - Confuses the positioning of points, not understanding that both time and temperature should be positive.
