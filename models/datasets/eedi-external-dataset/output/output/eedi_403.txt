Question: Which diagram represents the graphical solution to: \( \begin{array}{c} 2x + y = 10 \\ y = -\frac{1}{2}x + 4 \end{array} \)

###
Answers:
(A) - ![A four quadrant plane. Y axis -2 to 10 and x axis -5 to 5. A blue line goes from bottom left to top right sloping upwards. It goes through (-4, 0) and (0, 4). A red line goes from bottom left to top right sloping upwards. It goes through (0, -3) and (8, 0)]()

(B) - ![A four quadrant plane. Y axis -5 to 10 and x axis -5 to 5. A blue line goes from top left to bottom right sloping downwards. It goes through (0, 10) and (5, 0). A red line goes from bottom left to top right sloping upwards. It goes through (0, 4) and (8, 0)]()

(C) - ![A four quadrant plane. Y axis -1 to 6 and x axis -2 to 8. A blue line goes from top left to bottom right sloping downwards. It goes through (0, 6) and (6, 0). A red line goes from top left to bottom right sloping downwards. It goes through (4, 0) and (0, 4)]()

(D) - ![A four quadrant plane. Y axis -1 to 5 and x axis -3 to 8. A blue line goes from bottom left to top right sloping upwards. It goes through (0, 10) and (5, 0). A red line goes from top left to bottom right sloping downwards. It goes through (0, 4) and (8, 0)]()

Misconceptions:
(A) - Believes the first equation has a positive slope instead of a negative slope for the second line.
(B) - Misinterprets the y-intercept of the first line to be higher than it actually is.
(C) - Confuses the direction of line slopes, thinking both lines should be downward sloping.
(D) - nan
