Question: What is the solution set to the inequality represented by the shaded area? ![A graph showing a parabola opening upwards, with the region below the x-axis shaded between two roots.]() 

###
Answers:
(A) - \( x^{2}-4x+3 \leq 0 \) 

(B) - \( x^{2}-4x+3 \geq 0 \) 

(C) - \( x^{2}-4x+3 < 0 \) 

(D) - \( x^{2}-4x+3 > 0 \) 

###
Misconceptions:
(A) - Thinks that the region below the x-axis includes the roots themselves 

(B) - Thinks that the region corresponds to values outside the roots rather than within 

(C) - nan 

(D) - Misunderstands that the shaded region indicates values where the function is positive instead of negative
