Question: Emily and Sarah are debating whether the points \( (5, 0) \) and \( (0, -4) \) lie on the line \( 3x + 4y = 12 \).

Emily claims that \( (5, 0) \) lies on the line \( \mathbf{3 x}+\mathbf{4 y}=\mathbf{1 2} \).

Sarah argues that \( (0, -4) \) lies on the same line \( \mathbf{3} \boldsymbol{x}+\mathbf{4 y}=\mathbf{1 2} \).

Who is correct? 

###
Answers:
(A) - Only Emily 

(B) - Only Sarah 

(C) - Both Emily and Sarah 

(D) - Neither is correct 

###
Misconceptions:
(A) - Incorrect substitution of the point coordinates into the equation, leading to an inaccurate conclusion about the point's validity. 

(B) - Miscalculating the \( y \)-value by not properly evaluating the equation when \( x = 0 \).

(C) - Misunderstanding that even if one point lies on the line, it doesn't mean both do.

(D) - Recognizing that both points do not satisfy the line's equation based on proper evaluation.
