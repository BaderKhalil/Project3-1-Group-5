Question: The perimeter of a rectangle is \( 30 \mathrm{~cm} \) and the length is \( x + 5 \) cm while the width is \( x \) cm. What is the value of \( x \)?

###
Answers:
(A) - \( x = 5 \) 

(B) - \( x = 10 \) 

(C) - \( x = 15 \) 

(D) - \( x = 0 \) 

###
Misconceptions:
(A) - Believes the perimeter formula does not account for both pairs of sides properly. 

(B) - Believes the width is larger than the length without verifying the dimensions. 

(C) - Believes that \( x \) can be greater than the total perimeter divided by the number of sides. 

(D) - Believes that if one dimension is 0, the other dimension can still be positive.
