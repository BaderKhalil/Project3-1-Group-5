Question: A cylinder has a volume of 
\[
V \mathrm{~cm}^{3} \text {. }
\] ![A cylinder with the height labelled '?']() What is its height given the radius is \( r \)? 

###
Answers:
(A) - \( \frac{V}{\pi r^2} \mathrm{~cm} \) 

(B) - \( \frac{V}{3 \pi r^2} \mathrm{cm} \) 

(C) - \( \frac{3V}{\pi r^2} \mathrm{cm} \) 

(D) - \( \frac{\pi r^2 V}{h} \mathrm{cm} \) 

###
Misconceptions:
(A) - nan 

(B) - Incorrectly incorporates a factor of 3 in the volume formula for a cylinder 

(C) - Misinterprets the relationship between volume, height, and radius by incorrectly scaling the answer 

(D) - Confuses the position of variables in the formula, not isolating height correctly
