Question: What is the equation of this cubic curve? ![A cubic curve that passes through (0,0), (1,0), and (2,0) on the x-axis.]() 

###
Answers:
(A) - \( y = x(x-1)(x-2) \)

(B) - \( y = x^3 - 3x^2 + 2x \)

(C) - \( y = x(x^2 - 3) \)

(D) - \( y = x^3 - 2x + 1 \)

###
Misconceptions:
(A) - Forgetting that the sign of the roots must match their position on the x-axis 

(B) - Misunderstands how to expand a product of roots into a polynomial and adds extra terms incorrectly 

(C) - Mistaking the form of a cubic function, thinking it can be factored into a linear term and a quadratic that doesn't fit the given roots 

(D) - Incorrectly adds a constant term when factoring, ignoring the essential roots of the polynomial
