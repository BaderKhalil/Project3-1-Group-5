Question: If the slope of one line is \( 2 \), what is the slope of a line that is perpendicular to it? 

###
Answers:
(A) - \( -\frac{1}{2} \) 

(B) - \( \frac{1}{2} \) 

(C) - \( 2 \) 

(D) - \( -2 \) 

###
Misconceptions:
(A) - nan 

(B) - Thinks that the slope of a perpendicular line is obtained by simply flipping the fraction of the original slope 

(C) - Believes that a line with the same slope can also be perpendicular 

(D) - Thinks that the negative sign doesn't apply to the reciprocal of a positive slope
