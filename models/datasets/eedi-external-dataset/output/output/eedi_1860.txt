Question: Sarah and John are debating how to solve this equation:
\(2x + 3 = 5x - 12\)

Sarah claims you can simplify to: \(3 + 12 = 5x - 2x\)

John argues that you can transform it to: \(2x - 5x = -12 - 3\)

Who is correct?

###
Answers:
(A) - Only Sarah

(B) - Only John

(C) - Both Sarah and John
