Question: In a right triangle, if one leg measures \( 9 \mathrm{~cm} \) and the hypotenuse measures \( 15 \mathrm{~cm} \), what is the length of the other leg \( q \)? ![Right triangle with legs labelled \( 9 \mathrm{~cm} \) and \( q \mathrm{~cm} \), and hypotenuse labelled \( 15 \mathrm{~cm} \)]()

###
Answers:
(A) - \( 12 \mathrm{~cm} \) 

(B) - \( 6 \mathrm{~cm} \) 

(C) - \( 10 \mathrm{~cm} \) 

(D) - Not enough information 

###
Misconceptions:
(A) - Correct; this answer can be obtained using the Pythagorean theorem. 

(B) - Incorrect subtraction of values, possibly miscalculating the relationship between the sides of the triangle. 

(C) - Incorrect application of the Pythagorean theorem, assuming the lengths add up differently. 

(D) - Fails to recognize that we can apply the Pythagorean theorem to find missing side lengths in a right triangle.
