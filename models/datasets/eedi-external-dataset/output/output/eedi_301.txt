Question: What is the measure of angle \( y \) in the figure where one angle is labeled \( 120^{\circ} \) and they are adjacent angles around a point? ![Two adjacent angles, one labeled 120 degrees and the other y.]() 

###
Answers:
(A) - \( 240^{\circ} \)

(B) - \( 60^{\circ} \)

(C) - \( 90^{\circ} \)

(D) - \( 30^{\circ} \)

###
Misconceptions:
(A) - Misunderstands angle relationships and thinks angles can exceed 360 degrees 

(B) - Correctly evaluates the supplementary angle but miscalculates 

(C) - Incorrectly assumes one of the angles is a right angle without analyzing the given angle 

(D) - Estimates angle without applying the fundamental rule of supplementary angles
