Question: This temperature-time graph shows the temperature change in a room over the first \( 6 \) hours.

At what time did the temperature first reach \( 25^{\circ}C \)? ![The image is of a graph. Its vertical axis is labelled Temperature (Â°C) and has the scale 20, 22, 24, 26, 28 marked in even steps. Its horizontal axis is labelled Time (hours) and has the scale 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 marked in even steps. 
The graph consists of three sections. The first section is a straight slanted line from (0,20) to (2, 25). The second section is a horizontal line from (2, 25) to (4, 25). The third section is a slanted line from (4, 25) to (6, 20).]()

Answers:
(A) - \( 2 \mathrm{hours} \) 

(B) - \( 3 \mathrm{hours} \) 

(C) - \( 4 \mathrm{hours} \) 

(D) - \( 5 \mathrm{hours} \) 

###
Misconceptions:
(A) - nan 

(B) - Assumes the temperature increase continuously after reaching \( 25^{\circ}C \) and does not check the horizontal section. 

(C) - Misreads the graph, thinking that temperature can only be recorded at the peaks. 

(D) - Reads the graph incorrectly, thinking the temperature continuously decreased after \( 25^{\circ}C \).
