###
Answers:

(B) - \( 23 \)

(C) - \( 22 \)

(D) - \( 30 \)

###
Misconceptions:
(A) - Miscalculates the differences as doubling rather than observing the pattern of incrementing squares. 

(B) - Confuses the sequence with one where all terms are odd numbers, misjudging the increment needed.

(C) - Correctly follows the pattern but might miscount the order of operations leading to an early term.

(D) - Overshoots the required term by continuing the pattern into a nonlinear sequence.
