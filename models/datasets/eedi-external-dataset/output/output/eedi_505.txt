Question: \( \frac{5}{8} \) of a class are girls. What would be a possible ratio of girls to boys? 

###
Answers:
(A) - \( 5: 3 \) 

(B) - \( 5: 8 \) 

(C) - \( 5: 2 \) 

(D) - \( 3: 5 \) 

###
Misconceptions:
(A) - Calculates the ratio correctly but fails to account for the total number of boys represented in the class. 

(B) - Uses the denominator for the number of girls directly, rather than considering how many boys are present. 

(C) - Assumes the remainder of the class must total to 2 instead of calculating based on the remaining fraction after girls. 

(D) - Gets the order of the ratio wrong, representing boys first when girls are the larger group.
