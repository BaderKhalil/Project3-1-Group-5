Question: The temperature \( T \) in a room increases during the day due to sunlight, experiences a peak, and then gradually cools down in the evening. Which of the following sketches best illustrates this scenario?

###
Answers:
(A) - ![A graph with time on the horizontal axis and temperature on the vertical axis. The graph starts at a low temperature, increases steadily to a peak, and then sharply drops.]() 

(B) - ![A graph with time on the horizontal axis and temperature on the vertical axis. The graph starts low, rises quickly to a peak, and slowly declines afterwards.]() 

(C) - ![A graph with time on the horizontal axis and temperature on the vertical axis. The graph rises very slightly, peaks quickly, and then levels off near high temperature.]() 

(D) - ![A graph with time on the horizontal axis and temperature on the vertical axis. The graph starts at a low temperature, rises gradually to a peak, and then decreases gradually.]() 

###
Misconceptions:
(A) - Assumes the temperature drops steeply after reaching a peak, which is unrealistic for gradual cooling. 

(B) - Misunderstands that the rise in temperature would not be sharp; it typically occurs steadily due to sunlight.

(C) - Thinks that a slight rise can still lead to a rapid peak without considering a realistic temperature change.

(D) - nan
