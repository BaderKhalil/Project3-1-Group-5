Question: A geometric sequence starts with the first term \( 48 \), and each term is multiplied by \( 2 \). What is the \( 5^{\text{th}} \) term in this sequence?

###
Answers:
(A) \( 384 \)

(B) \( 192 \)

(C) \( 48 \)

(D) \( 96 \)

###
Misconceptions:
(A) - Believes that the last term indicates the total multiplied result of the first term and ignores the sequential multiplying.

(B) - Correctly applies the multiplication but fails to calculate how many times to repeat it for the \( 5^{\text{th}} \) term.

(C) - Thinks the first term remains constant without considering the multiplication by \( 2 \).

(D) - Applies the multiplication incorrectly assumes the \( 5^{\text{th}} \) term is just the first term multiplied by \( 2 \) once.
