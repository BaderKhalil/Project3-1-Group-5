Question: To find the circumference \( C \) of a circle, the formula is given by \( C = 2\pi r \). Rearrange this formula to solve for the radius \( r \). ![An image of a circle with the radius labelled r.]() 

###
Answers:
(A) - \( r = \frac{C}{2\pi} \)

(B) - \( r = \frac{C}{\pi} \) 

(C) - \( r = \frac{C^2}{2\pi} \) 

(D) - They are all incorrect 

###
Misconceptions:
(A) - nan 

(B) - Confuses the division by \( 2\pi \) with just \( \pi \), therefore receives an incorrect value for r. 

(C) - Incorrectly applies the formula by squaring the circumference instead of applying the inverse operation. 

(D) - nan
