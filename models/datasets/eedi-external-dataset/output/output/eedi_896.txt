Question: Sarah and John are examining the equation:
\[
2a + 4b = 20
\]
Sarah transforms it to:
\[
a + 2b = 10
\]
John writes:
\[
4a + 8b = 40
\]
Who has correctly derived a related linear equation?

###
Answers:
(A) - Only John 

(B) - Only Sarah 

(C) - Both Sarah and John 

(D) - Neither is correct 

###
Misconceptions:
(A) - Does not recognize that John correctly multiplied the entire equation by a consistent factor.

(B) - Does not realize that Sarah simplified the equation correctly by dividing both sides by 2.

(C) - Confuses how to maintain equation equivalence when re-arranging or scaling equations.

(D) - Fails to understand that a linear equation can be scaled as long as all terms are consistently adjusted.
