Question: ![A line graph with title "Temperature over the Day". 
The x-axis is titled "Time in Hours" and the scale is labelled from 0 to 24 hours in steps of 6 hours.
The y-axis is titled "Temperature in Â°C" and the scale is labelled from -10 to 40 in steps of 10 degrees. The following points are plotted and joined together: (0, 5), (6, 10), (12, 20), (18, 15), (24, 7).
]() What was the change in temperature from \( 6 \) hours to \( 18 \) hours? 

###
Answers:
(A) - \( 5 \) 

(B) - \( 15 \) 

(C) - \( 10 \) 

(D) - \( 8 \) 

###
Misconceptions:
(A) - Calculates using the incorrect starting point for the difference. 

(B) - Calculates the total change across all hours rather than just between two specific points. 

(C) - Misunderstands the direction of change, wrongly interpreting the temperature decrease as increase. 

(D) - Incorrectly assesses the temperature at one point instead of considering both specified times.
