Question: A subscription service charges a monthly fee of \( £10 \) and then \( £2 \) for each movie streamed. Emma makes a graph showing the total cost based on the number of movies watched. Which of the following graphs would best represent Emma's sketch?

###
Answers:
(A) - ![A graph with movies on the horizontal axis and total cost on the vertical axis. The graph starts at the origin and shows a straight line that has a gradual upward slope.]() 

(B) - ![A graph with movies on the horizontal axis and total cost on the vertical axis. The graph starts at a point on the positive vertical axis and shows a straight line traveling upwards but not horizontally.]() 

(C) - ![A graph with movies on the horizontal axis and total cost on the vertical axis. The graph starts at a point on the positive vertical axis and travels upwards but never actually steps downwards.]() 

(D) - ![A graph with movies on the horizontal axis and total cost on the vertical axis. The graph starts at a point on the vertical axis and travels upwards in a straight line with a slope.]() 

###
Misconceptions:
(A) - Assumes there are no fixed charges involved in the cost calculation

(B) - Believes that the graph can start at the fixed cost but does not account for the cost accumulating with each movie

(C) - Misunderstands that the total cost will always be greater than the fixed monthly fee without consideration of additional charges 

(D) - nan
