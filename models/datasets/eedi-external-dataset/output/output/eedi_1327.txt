Question: How many distinct terms will result from expanding and simplifying the expression?
\(
(x+3)(x+5)(x+2)
\)

###
Answers:
(A) - \( 6 \) 

(B) - \( 4 \) 

(C) - \( 3 \) 

(D) - \( 8 \) 

###
Misconceptions:
(A) - Believes that every combination of the products will create a distinct term

(B) - Believes that the product of three binomials leads to four distinct terms due to ignoring like terms

(C) - Thinks a cubic expression should only yield three terms when expanded

(D) - Thinks that the combination of all products leads to eight distinct terms without considering simplification
