Question: Sarah and David are discussing the coordinates of points and their distance from the origin. 

Sarah claims that the points \( (-5, 3) \) and \( (5, -3) \) are equidistant from the origin. 
David argues that the points \( (0, 4) \) and \( (0, -4) \) are equidistant from the origin. 

Who is accurate in their assessment?

###

(A) - Understands the concept of distance calculation correctly 

(B) - Misunderstands that negative coordinates affect the distance absolutely rather than squared 

(C) - Fails to recognize that only one pair is valid; assumes both can be 

(D) - Miscalculates distance using inappropriate methods, like averaging coordinates
