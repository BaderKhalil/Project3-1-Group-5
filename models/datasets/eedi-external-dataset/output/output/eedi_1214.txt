Question: What is the first step we should take when solving the quadratic equation?

\(
2x^{2} + 8x - 10 = 0
\)

###
Answers:
(A) - Multiply both sides by \( \frac{1}{2} \)

(B) - Move \( -10 \) to the right side by adding \( 10 \)

(C) - Add \( 10 \) to both sides of the equation

(D) - Factor out \( 2 \) from the left side of the equation

###
Misconceptions:
(A) - Thinks that scaling the equation will help without realising we need to rearrange it to the standard form first.

(B) - Incorrectly assumes we can rearrange by only considering one term instead of bringing the equation to standard form.

(C) - Thinks that simply adding \( 10 \) will correctly set up the equation for factoring without bringing all terms to one side.

(D) - Assumes factoring out \( 2 \) is a valid first step, not recognizing the requirement to have \( 0 \) on one side for factorisation.
