Question: The point \( Q \) has coordinates \( (5, 2) \). What are the new coordinates of point \( Q \) after reflecting it in the \( x \)-axis? 

###
Answers:
(A) - \( (5, -2) \) 

(B) - \( (5, 2) \) 

(C) - \( (-5, 2) \) 

(D) - \( (-5, -2) \) 

###
Misconceptions:
(A) - nan 

(B) - Fails to understand that reflection changes the sign of the \( y \)-coordinate 

(C) - Fails to reflect across mirror line and incorrectly changes the \( x \)-coordinate 

(D) - Fails to reflect across mirror line and incorrectly changes both coordinates
