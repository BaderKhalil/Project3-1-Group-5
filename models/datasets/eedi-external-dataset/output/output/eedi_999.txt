Question: The graph on the right shows the speed of a car over time.

What might the horizontal section represent? ![A graph with time (seconds) on the horizontal axis and speed (km/h) on the vertical axis. The graph starts at the origin, climbs steeply up, remains flat horizontally, then descends back down steeply to the x-axis.]()

Answers:
(A) - The car is accelerating 

(B) - The car is maintaining a constant speed

(D) - The car is driving in reverse 

###
Misconceptions:
(A) - Believes that the speed of the car can only increase 

(B) - Correctly identifies a horizontal line as a constant speed 

(C) - Confuses horizontal motion with a decrease in speed 

(D) - Assumes horizontal motion implies a decrease in forward movement
