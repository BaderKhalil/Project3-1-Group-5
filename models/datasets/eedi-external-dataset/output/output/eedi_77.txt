Question: Which of the following equations represents a line parallel to 
\[
y=-2x+4 ?
\] 

###
Answers:
(A) - \( y=-2x-3 \) 

(B) - \( y=\frac{1}{2}x+3 \) 

(C) - \( y=2x+1 \) 

(D) - \( y=-x+5 \) 

###
Misconceptions:
(A) - Correctly identifies a line with the same slope as the original line 

(B) - Believes parallel lines have the same slope, but confuses the sign 

(C) - Confuses the meaning of parallel and perpendicular, resulting in a different slope 

(D) - Misunderstands how to manipulate equations, resulting in a line with a different slope
