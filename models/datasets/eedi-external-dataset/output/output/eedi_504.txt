Question: Which of the following could be the equation of this quadratic curve? ![A quadratic curve with a maximum turning point at (1, 4). The curve crosses the x-axis at the points (0,0) and (2,0). It crosses the y-axis at (0,2).]() 

###
Answers:
(A) - \( y = -(x-2)(x) \)

(B) - \( y = (x-1)(x-2) \)

(C) - \( y = -(x+1)(x-2) \)

(D) - \( y = -(x)(x-2) \)

###
Misconceptions:
(A) - Correctly identifies the roots but forgets to consider the maximum turning point, leading to a negative leading coefficient.

(B) - Incorrectly finds the roots and does not account for the direction of the curve.

(C) - Confuses the sign of the roots, leading to potential misunderstanding of the parabolaâ€™s behavior.

(D) - Uses the correct roots but incorrectly assumes the leading coefficient should be negative without analyzing the vertex.
