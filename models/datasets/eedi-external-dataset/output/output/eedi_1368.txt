Question: What is the value of \( x \) when \( y=0 \) ?

Give your answer(s) to \( 1 \) decimal place ![A parabolic graph opening upwards. The graph intersects the x-axis at (-3, 0), (1, 0) and goes through the point (0, -3).]()

###
Answers:
(A) - \( \begin{array}{c} x=-3 \\ \text{ and } x=1 \end{array} \)

(B) - \( x=0 \) 

(C) - \( \begin{array}{c} x=0 \\ \text{ and } x=3 \end{array} \) 

(D) - \( x=1.5 \) 

###
Misconceptions:
(A) - Correctly identifies both x-intercepts but does not represent them as a single answer choice. 

(B) - Incorrectly assumes that \( y=0 \) corresponds to \( x=0 \) without checking the graph. 

(C) - Misreads the graph, thinking there are x-intercepts at positive x-values without validating against the graph. 

(D) - Wrongly selects a value that does not correspond to any x-intercept where \( y=0 \).
