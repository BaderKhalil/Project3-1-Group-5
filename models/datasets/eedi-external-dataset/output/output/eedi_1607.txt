Question: Emily is solving the equation \( 24=\frac{3+m}{6} \). She follows these steps: Step \( 1: \) \( 144=3+m \)

Step \( 2: \) \( 141=m \) Which steps, if any, are correct?

###
Answers:
(A) - Only step \( 1 \) 

(B) - Only step \( 2 \) 

(C) - Both steps are correct 

(D) - Both steps are incorrect 

###
