Question: Emily and Ryan are discussing how to solve the equation:
\(
4x - 8 = 16
\)
Emily believes you can simplify it to \( 4x = 24 \). Ryan thinks it's correct to say \( x - 2 = 4 \). Who is right?

###
Answers:
(A) - Only Emily 

(B) - Only Ryan 

(C) - Both Emily and Ryan 

(D) - Neither is correct 

###
Misconceptions:
(A) - Believes that adding 8 to both sides correctly isolates the term with the variable 

(B) - Misunderstands how to deal with subtraction and incorrectly decides to drop the coefficient of x 

(C) - Thinks both methods can yield valid simplifications without fully solving the equation 

(D) - Thinks the equation requires a completely different approach before simplifying
