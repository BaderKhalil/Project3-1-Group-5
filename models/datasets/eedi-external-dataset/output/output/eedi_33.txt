        Question: A car travels at a steady speed and then starts to decelerate as it approaches a stop sign. 

This graph shows the relationship between the speed \( (s) \) of the car and time \( (t) \).

Which of the following scenarios is this graph most likely representing? ![A speed-time graph which begins at a constant velocity, then curves downwards to meet the time axis, indicating a decrease in speed before a complete stop.]() 

        ###
        Answers:
        (A) - ![A car smoothly accelerating before coming to a stop at an intersection.]() 

        (B) - ![A car moving at a steady speed without any change.]() 

        (C) - ![A car that is speeding up, indicated by an increasing steepness in the line.]() 

        (D) - ![A car smoothly decelerating as it approaches a stop light.]()

        Misconceptions:
        (A) - Fails to recognize that the graph does not indicate acceleration but instead shows deceleration 

        (B) - Misunderstands that constant speed would not show a downward trend in the graph 

        (C) - Confuses the decreasing speed with an accelerating speed due to the curvature of the graph 

        (D) - nan
