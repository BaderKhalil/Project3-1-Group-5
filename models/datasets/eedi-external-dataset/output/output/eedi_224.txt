(B) - \( 15 \mathrm{~cm} \) 

(C) - \( 5 \mathrm{~cm} \) 

(D) - \( 25 \mathrm{~cm} \) 

###
Misconceptions:
(A) - Multiplies the given side by an incorrect factor instead of dividing the area by the given side 

(B) - Assumes a simple addition to find the missing side rather than performing the appropriate division 

(C) - Confuses the side lengths, thinking both sides can be equal instead of applying the area formula 

(D) - Incorrectly scales the area to get an exaggerated length
