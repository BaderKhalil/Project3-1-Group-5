Question: The area of this trapezoid is \( 30 \mathrm{~cm}^{2} \)

What measurement should replace the star in the height? ![Trapezoid with bases length 10cm and 5cm, and the height has a star symbol.]() 

###
Answers:
(A) - \( 4 \mathrm{~cm} \) 

(B) - \( 6 \mathrm{~cm} \) 

(C) - \( 2 \mathrm{~cm} \) 

(D) - Not enough information 

###
Misconceptions:
(A) - Correct calculation since area = \( \frac{1}{2} \times (b_1 + b_2) \times h \), substituting values correctly leads to height = \( 4 \mathrm{~cm} \). 

(B) - Assumes height must be greater than one of the bases without proper calculations of the area formula. 

(C) - When finding the height, incorrectly applies the formula by not including both bases in the addition step. 

(D) - Does not realize that you can calculate the height of a trapezoid when area and base lengths are known.
