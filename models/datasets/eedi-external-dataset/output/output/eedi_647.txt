Question: \(5 \sqrt{2} + 3 \sqrt{2}\)

Simplify, if possible.

###
Answers:
(A) - \(8 \sqrt{2}\)

(B) - \(15 \sqrt{4}\)

(C) - \(5 + 3\)

(D) - \(\sqrt{10}\)

###
Misconceptions:
(A) - Incorrectly thinks that when adding surds with the same radicand, the coefficients are added without any additional multiplication or simplification.

(B) - Assumes that adding surds involves multiplying the integers and simplifying under the square root.

(C) - Fails to recognize that the numbers must remain as coefficients of the surd when simplified.

(D) - Misunderstands that the sum of surds results in another surd and tries to simplify inaccurately.
