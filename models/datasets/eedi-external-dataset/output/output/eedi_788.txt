Question: What are the coordinates of the vertex of the graph of \( y=(x+3)^{2}-5 \) ? 

###
Answers:
(A) - \( (-3,-5) \) 

(B) - \( (-3,5) \) 

(C) - \( (3,-5) \) 

(D) - \( (3,5) \) 

###
Misconceptions:
(A) - nan 

(B) - Confuses the signs and assumes the vertex coordinates are both positive due to misinterpretation of the vertex form 

(C) - Incorrectly believes that the vertex is derived from the opposite signs of the constants in the factorized form 

(D) - Thinks that the vertex is found by always using positive values from the quadratic expression
