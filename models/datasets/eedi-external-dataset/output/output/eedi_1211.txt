Question: What is the calculation for the area of the face of this cuboid labelled \( \boldsymbol{R} \) ('the front face')? ![An image of a cuboid, with the height marked as 5cm, the width as 3cm, and the length as 6cm. The front face is shaded blue and marked R. ]() 

###
Answers:
(A) - \( 5 \mathrm{~cm} \times 6 \mathrm{~cm} \)

(B) - \( 3 \mathrm{~cm} \times 5 \mathrm{~cm} \)

(C) - \( 3 \mathrm{~cm} \times 6 \mathrm{~cm} \)

(D) - \( 5 \mathrm{~cm} \times 3 \mathrm{~cm} \)

###
Misconceptions:
(A) - Confuses the face and dimensions, using incorrect side lengths 

(B) - Cannot identify the correct dimension to use when asked for the area of the front face 

(C) - Cannot identify the correct dimension to use when asked for the area of the front face 

(D) - Finds area but does not use the length but mixes the dimensions
