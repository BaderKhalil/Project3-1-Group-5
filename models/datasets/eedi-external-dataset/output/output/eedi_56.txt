        Question: If Sarah has \( 12 \) apples and Tom has twice as many, write the number of apples Sarah and Tom have as a ratio, with Sarah's part first. 

        ###
        Answers:
        (A) - \( 1: 2 \) 

        (B) - \( 12: 24 \) 

        (C) - \( 12: 12 \) 

        (D) - \( 3: 2 \) 

        ###
        Misconceptions:
        (A) - Misunderstands that the ratio represents the quantity of Sarah compared to Tom, not a portion of their combined total.
        
        (B) - Incorrectly assumes the ratio includes the total number of fruits instead of simplifying it based on Sarah's count.
        
        (C) - Fails to realize Sarah has a different number of apples than Tom, leading to the equal ratio.
        
        (D) - Misinterprets the numerical relationship necessary for forming a proper ratio with Sarah's and Tom's counts.
