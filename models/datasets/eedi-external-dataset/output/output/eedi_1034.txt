Question: Which number line best represents the position of the number shown?

###
Answers:
(A) - ![A number line from 0 to 1000 with the value 250 incorrectly labelled, with an arrow, before the first quarter]() 

(B) - ![A number line from 0 to 500 with the value 450 correctly labelled, with an arrow, just before the endpoint]() 

(C) - ![A number line from 500 to 1000 with the value 600 incorrectly labelled, with an arrow, just after the midpoint]() 

(D) - ![A number line from 0 to 1000 with the value 750 incorrectly labelled, with an arrow, just after the three-quarters point]() 

###
Misconceptions:
(A) - Believes 250 is close to 0 instead of accurately reading its position 

(B) - Correctly placed but may confuse the estimation range of 500

(C) - Misunderstands the midpoint and places the number incorrectly 

(D) - Misreads where three-quarters is on the number line
