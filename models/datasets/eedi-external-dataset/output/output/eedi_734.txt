Question: Which polygon has rotational symmetry order \( 3 \)?

###
Answers:
(A) - ![Triangle]()

(B) - ![Pentagon]()

(C) - ![Hexagon]()

(D) - ![Octagon]()

###
Misconceptions:
(A) - Does not know that a triangle has rotational symmetry order \( 3 \) when it is an equilateral triangle.

(B) - Misunderstands that a pentagon's rotational symmetry order is greater than \( 3 \).

(C) - Assumes that all hexagons have the same rotational symmetry order and does not connect it to the polygon's properties.

(D) - Ignores the correlation between the number of vertices and the order of rotational symmetry.
