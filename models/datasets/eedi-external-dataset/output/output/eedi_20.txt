Question: The volume of this cylinder is \( 60 \mathrm{~cm}^{3} \)

What radius should replace the star? ![A cylinder, height 4cm and radius labelled with a star.]()

###
Answers:
(A) - \( 3 \mathrm{~cm} \)

(B) - \( 2 \mathrm{~cm} \)

(C) - \( 5 \mathrm{~cm} \)

(D) - \( 10 \mathrm{~cm} \)

###
Misconceptions:
(A) - Assumes the radius is half the height instead of using the volume formula.

(B) - Correct calculation, correctly uses the formula for volume.

(C) - Computes based on an incorrect assumption of doubling dimensions.

(D) - Thinks that the volume can exceed the capacity of the cylinder based on mistakenly interpreting the formula.
