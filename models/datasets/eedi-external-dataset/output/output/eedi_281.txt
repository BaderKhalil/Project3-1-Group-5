Question: The volume of the cylinder on the right is \( 20\pi \mathrm{~cm}^{3} \).

To find the radius \( r \), John uses:
\(r_{n+1} = \sqrt{\frac{20}{\pi h}} - \frac{r_{n}^{2}}{2h}\)

If \( r_{0} = 1 \) and the height \( h = 2 \), what does \( r_{1} \) equal? ![A cylinder with the base labelled r and the height labelled h]() 

###
Answers:
(A) - \( 2 - \frac{1}{4} \)

(B) - \( \sqrt{\frac{10}{\pi}} \)

(C) - \( 1 \)

(D) - \( 2 \)

###
Misconceptions:
(A) - Misinterprets the formula and calculates incorrectly based on the parameters 

(B) - Confuses the operation of taking the square root with substituting and mismanages the variables

(C) - Underestimates the calculation by assuming the initial guess remains unchanged 

(D) - Incorrectly believes the final value should correspond directly with the height of the cylinder
