Question: Simplify the following expression, if possible:
\(
\frac{4x^2 + 12x}{2x^2 + 6x}
\)

###
Answers:
(A) - \( \frac{2x + 6}{x} \)

(B) - \( \frac{2(x + 3)}{x + 3} \)

(C) - \( \frac{2x}{x + 3} \)

(D) - Does not simplify 

###
Misconceptions:
(A) - Believes that terms can be modified rather than cancelled when simplifying expressions.

(B) - Thinks that cancelling the common factor \( (x + 3) \) leaves no effect on the other part of the fraction.

(C) - Assumes that simplification is limited to removing the greatest common factor without adjusting for remaining terms.

(D) - Correctly identifies that the expression does not simplify further.
