Question: This triangle is rotated 90 degrees counterclockwise around the origin. What are the new coordinates of the point marked \( \mathrm{A} \) after the rotation? ![A coordinate graph showing a triangle ABC plotted]() 

###
Answers:
(A) - \( (-3, 2) \) 

(B) - \( (2, -3) \) 

(C) - \( (3, -2) \) 

(D) - \( (-2, 3) \) 

###
Misconceptions:
(A) - Thinks rotation involves adding to both coordinates.  

(B) - Confuses the direction of rotation, thinking it results in positive values. 

(C) - Incorrectly applies the rotation formula resulting in a wrong quadrant. 

(D) - Correctly applies the rotation formula but miscalculates the signs.
