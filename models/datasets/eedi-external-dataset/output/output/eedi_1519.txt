Question: Aisha and Brian are analyzing a different sequence. The first term is represented by a single blue circle. The second term consists of the first term plus 2 additional blue circles. The third term consists of the second term but adds another 2 blue circles. Aisha claims that the number of blue circles in the \( 5^{\text {th }} \) term will be equal to the number of blue circles in the \( 2^{\text {nd }} \) term plus 6.

Brian believes that the total number of circles in the \( 5^{\text {th }} \) term will be equal to three times the number of circles in the \( 1^{\text {st }} \) term.

Who do you agree with? 
###
Answers:
(A) - Only Aisha 

(B) - Only Brian 

(C) - Both Aisha and Brian 

(D) - Neither is correct 
###
Misconceptions:
(A) - Miscalculates the total increase because the pattern consists of adding a fixed number, but Aisha misjudges the increments. 

(B) - Confuses the additive nature of the sequence with a multiplicative relationship, incorrectly multiplying rather than correctly adding the counts. 

(C) - Incorrectly assumes both predictions are valid despite contradicting underlying rules of the sequence.

(D) - May overlook the exact nature of the sequence but fails to recognize that neither Aisha nor Brian's statement aligns with the observable pattern.
