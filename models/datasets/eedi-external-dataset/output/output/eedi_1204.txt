Question: If you reflect the triangle in the vertical line, where does the marked vertex end up? ![A grid of 9 squares across and 7 squares up. A purple vertical line goes across the whole grid, it is 4 squares from the left edge of the grid. A green triangle (3 squares base and 4 squares height) is drawn to the right of the purple line. Vertically, the triangle is aligned with the grid, with its base sitting 3 squares above the bottom of the grid. The top vertex of the triangle is marked with a tiny red circle. A letter "A" is marking a point directly to the left of the tiny red circle, 2 squares aligned with the base of the triangle. A letter "B" is marking a point directly to the left of the tiny red circle, aligned with the apex of the triangle. A letter "C" is marking a point directly to the left of the tiny red circle, 1 square lower than the apex of the triangle. A letter "D" is marking a point that is 4 squares along from the tiny red circle, touching the base of the triangle. ]()
