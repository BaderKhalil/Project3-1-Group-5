Question: Solve 
\[
2x - 3 < 5x + 1
\] 

###
Answers:
(A) - \( x < -\frac{4}{3} \) 

(B) - \( x < 2 \) 

(C) - \( x > 2 \) 

(D) - \( x > -\frac{4}{3} \) 

###
Misconceptions:
(A) - Believes they should add the same value to both sides without considering the direction of the inequality. 

(B) - Wrongly simplifies the equation, forgetting to account for all terms when moving them across the inequality. 

(C) - Misunderstands the direction of the inequality after moving terms across or failing to do the proper operation. 

(D) - Correctly identifies the solution but thinks the inequality should be reversed when adding a negative.
