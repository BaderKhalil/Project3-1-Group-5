        Question: A price of \( $200 \) is first discounted by \( 30\% \). Then, an additional \( 20\% \) discount is applied to the new price. What percentage of the original price remains?

        ###
        Answers:
        (A) - \( 56\% \)

        (B) - \( 50\% \)

        (C) - \( 66\% \)

        (D) - \( 62\% \)

        ###
        Misconceptions:
        (A) - Miscalculated by applying the two discounts incorrectly and not taking the new amount into account for the remaining percentage. 

        (B) - Thinks that the final amount subtracted from the original amount directly gives the percentage remaining.

        (C) - Incorrectly calculated the total discounts, retaining more than what has actually been discounted.

        (D) - Misunderstood the process and applied the discount percentages without adjusting for the sequenced steps.
