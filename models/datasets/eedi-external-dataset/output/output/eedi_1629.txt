Question: Sarah and John are discussing the factors of a polynomial.
Sarah claims that \( x \) is a factor of \( 3x^2 + 6x \).
John argues that \( 2 \) is a factor of \( 3x^2 + 6x \).
Who is correct?

###
Answers:
(A) - Only Sarah 

(B) - Only John 

(C) - Both Sarah and John 

(D) - Neither is correct 

###
Misconceptions:
(A) - May not recognize that a variable like \( x \) cannot fully represent a factor if there are numeric coefficients that don't support it. 

(B) - May think that any number appearing in a polynomial coefficient is a factor without checking divisibility. 

(C) - Incorrectly assumes that both statements can be true simultaneously without verifying dependencies. 

(D) - Lacks understanding of how to properly apply the concept of factors to polynomial expressions.
