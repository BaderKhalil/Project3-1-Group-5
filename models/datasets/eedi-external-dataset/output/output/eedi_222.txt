Question: What is the solution set for the inequality represented by this graph? ![Graph showing the shaded area above a horizontal line that passes through the point (1, 2) and continues horizontally]() 

###
Answers:
(A) - \( y \geq 2 \) 

(B) - \( y < 2 \) 

(C) - \( y > 2 \) 

(D) - \( y \leq 2 \) 

###
Misconceptions:
(A) - Incorrectly interprets the inequality as including the line when it should include it only if it were a solid line. 

(B) - Confuses the shaded area being above the line, leading to the wrong interpretation of the inequality. 

(C) - Errors in understanding that the shaded region above the line indicates ‘greater than’, not ‘strictly greater than’. 

(D) - Misinterpretation of the inequality, thinks the shaded area includes points below the line.
