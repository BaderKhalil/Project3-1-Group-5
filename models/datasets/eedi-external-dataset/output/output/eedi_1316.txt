Question: \(\frac{\left(2^{5}\right)^{3}}{2^{4}} \equiv 2^{m}\)

What is the value of \( m \) ? 

###
Answers:
(A) - \( 4 \)

(B) - \( 5 \)

(C) - \( 7 \)

(D) - \( 11 \)

###
Misconceptions:
(A) - Thinks that subtracting powers leads to a lower exponent without considering the effect of raising a power to another power.

(B) - Believes that when raising a power to another power, it does not change the base's exponent.

(C) - Assumes that adding the exponent while raising to a power is the correct operation, leading to higher exponent values.

(D) - Underestimates the result by not properly applying the laws of indices during simplification.
