Question: What is the difference in temperature between \( -10^{\circ} \mathrm{C} \) and \( 5^{\circ} \mathrm{C} \)?

###
Answers:
(A) - \( 5^{\circ} \mathrm{C} \) is \( 15^{\circ} \mathrm{C} \) colder than \( -10^{\circ} \mathrm{C} \)

(B) - \( -10^{\circ} \mathrm{C} \) is \( 15^{\circ} \mathrm{C} \) colder than \( 5^{\circ} \mathrm{C} \)

(C) - The difference is \( 15^{\circ} \mathrm{C} \) hotter than \( -10^{\circ} \mathrm{C} \)

(D) - \( -10^{\circ} \mathrm{C} \) is \( 5^{\circ} \mathrm{C} \) hotter than \( 5^{\circ} \mathrm{C} \)

###
Misconceptions:
(A) - Confuses the concept of colder and hotter, not calculating the actual difference correctly.

(B) - nan 

(C) - Incorrectly adds temperatures instead of finding the difference.

(D) - Misunderstands the comparison of temperatures and the meaning of "hotter" and "colder."
