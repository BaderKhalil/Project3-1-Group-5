Question: \( \frac{1}{2}, \frac{2}{3}, \frac{3}{4}, \frac{4}{5}, \ldots \) When finding the nth-term formula for this sequence, which expression should replace the star? ![Text: "nth-term rule:" followed by a star, n and a blue rectangle.]() 

###
Answers:
(A) - \( \frac{n+1}{n+2} \) 

(B) - \( \frac{n}{n+1} \) 

(C) - \( \frac{n-1}{n} \) 

(D) - \( \frac{n+2}{n+1} \) 

###
Misconceptions:
(A) - Assumes the numerator increases by 1 each time while not considering the correct relationship with the denominator. 

(B) - Correctly identifies the structure but mistakenly implies a different pattern where the last term is always equal to the current term.

(C) - Confuses the position of the numerator and denominator, incorrectly interpreting the sequence's trend.

(D) - nan
