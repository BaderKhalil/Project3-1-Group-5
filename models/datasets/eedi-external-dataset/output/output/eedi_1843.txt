Question: Maria is riding her bicycle. The graph on the right shows Maria's speed in kilometres per hour \( (s) \) over time in minutes \( (t) \).

The gradient of the increasing sloping section of the graph is \( 1.5 \).

Which of the following does that \( 1.5 \) best represent? ![A sketch of a graph with s on the y axis and t on the x axis. A straight line slopes upwards from the origin for the entirety of the graph, showing a steady increase in speed.]() 

###
Answers:
(A) - Maria is travelling at a speed of \( 1.5 \mathrm{~km/h} \) 

(B) - Maria is accelerating at a rate of \( 1.5 \mathrm{~km/h}^2 \) 

(C) - Maria is resting for \( 1.5 \) minutes 

(D) - Maria is decelerating at a rate of \( 1.5 \mathrm{~km/h}^2 \) 

###
Misconceptions:
(A) - Believes the gradient of a speed-time graph is the speed at a particular time

(B) - Believes that an increase in speed over time indicates acceleration rate rather than speed change

(C) - Assumes a flat line implies resting, not realizing that only acceleration or constant speed is depicted

(D) - Misunderstands that a positive slope indicates acceleration rather than deceleration
