Question: During a geometry class, Mark states that alternate interior angles are equal when two parallel lines are cut by a transversal. Lisa claims that interior angles on the same side of the transversal are supplementary. Who is correct?

###
Answers:
(A) - Only Mark

(B) - Only Lisa

(C) - Both Mark and Lisa

(D) - Neither is correct

###
Misconceptions:
(A) - Thinks that all angles formed by a transversal with parallel lines have the same measure

(B) - Misunderstands that angles on the same side of the transversal must always add up to 180 degrees

(C) - Thinks that there are multiple angle relationships that are simultaneously correct

(D) - Believes that alternate interior angles are not equal
