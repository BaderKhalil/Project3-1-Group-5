        Question: What is the size of the marked angle? ![A protractor showing an angle that opens from 90 degrees to approximately 150 degrees, with the two red lines marking the boundaries of the angle. The angle is acute and measured in a clockwise direction.]()

        Answers:
        (A) - \( 120^{\circ} \) 

        (B) - \( 60^{\circ} \) 

        (C) - \( 150^{\circ} \) 

        (D) - \( 140^{\circ} \)

        Misconceptions:
        (A) - Misreads the protractor and calculates an obtuse angle instead of noting the acute angle range. 

        (B) - This number is too small to represent the angle measured, which leads to underestimating its size. 

        (C) - Identifies the angle correctly but misinterprets the full angle instead of the smaller, acute angle measured. 

        (D) - nan
