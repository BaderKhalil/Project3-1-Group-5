Answers:
(A) - ![A sequence of 4 patterns. The first pattern is one orange circle. The second pattern is a row of 2 orange circles. The third pattern is a row of 3 orange circles. The fourth pattern is a row of 4 orange circles.]()

(B) - ![A sequence of 4 patterns. The first pattern is a rectangle with width 1 and height 4. The second pattern is a rectangle with width 2 and height 4. The third pattern is a rectangle with width 3 and height 4. The fourth pattern is a rectangle with width 4 and height 4.]()

(C) - ![A sequence of 4 patterns. The first pattern is one yellow square. The other patterns are squares made of yellow dots: Pattern 2 is a 2 by 2 square; Pattern 3 is a 3 by 3 square; Pattern 4 is a 4 by 4 square.]()

(D) - ![A sequence of 4 patterns. The first pattern is a line of 4 green dots. The second pattern is a square of 2 dots. The third pattern is a square of 3 dots. The fourth pattern is a square of 4 dots.]()

Misconceptions:
(A) - When given a quadratic sequence, cannot relate it to a growing linear pattern 

(B) - Fails to recognize the relationship between terms and their positions in terms of square values 

(C) - Identifies patterns based on an incorrect interpretation of geometric shapes instead of the numerical sequence 

(D) - Uses incorrect reasoning regarding the arrangement of dots, leading to confusion with dimensions rather than value representation
