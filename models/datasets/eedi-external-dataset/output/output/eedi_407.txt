Question: ![A speed-time graph. At 4 seconds, the car is travelling at a speed of 12 metres per second. After 6 seconds, the car is travelling at a speed of 16 metres per second. ]() Here is a speed-time graph for a car.

Which of the following gives the best estimate for the distance travelled between \( 4 \) and \( 6 \) seconds? 

###
Answers:
(A) - \( 26 m \) 

(B) - \( 14 m \) 

(C) - \( 22 m \) 

(D) - \( 34 m \) 

###
Misconceptions:
(A) - Believes the area calculation involves only the height at the higher point instead of considering the average speed.

(B) - Underestimates the total distance by only considering the value at \( 4 \) seconds.

(C) - nan 

(D) - Overestimates the distance by incorrectly calculating the total area under the graph.
