Question: Simplify the following expression by collecting like terms
\(4a + 3b - 2a + 5b\)

###
Answers:
(A) - \(2a + 8b\) 

(B) - \(6a + 2b\) 

(C) - \(1a + 8b\) 

(D) - \(2a + 2b\) 

###
Misconceptions:
(A) - When collecting like terms, adds the coefficients incorrectly, leading to an inflated output for \(b\). 

(B) - Fails to combine like terms properly and ends up adding instead of simplifying. 

(C) - Misunderstands the correct combination of terms, treating the process as merely addition rather than simplification. 

(D) - When collecting like terms, misassigns the coefficients resulting in an incorrect final expression.
