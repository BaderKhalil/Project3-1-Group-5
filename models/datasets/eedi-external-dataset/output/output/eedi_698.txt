Question: ![A bag contains 3 red, 4 blue, and 5 green marbles.]() If you randomly select one marble from the bag and then replace it, what is the probability of drawing a red marble followed by a blue marble?

###
Answers:
(A) - \( \frac{3}{12} \) 

(B) - \( \frac{1}{3} \) 

(C) - \( \frac{3}{16} \) 

(D) - \( \frac{4}{12} \) 

###
Misconceptions:
(A) - Incorrectly calculated the probability by not accounting for the total number of marbles when finding the probability of the second marble. 

(B) - Misunderstands the multiplication of probabilities for independent events and uses the incorrect method for combining events. 

(C) - Incorrectly calculates the overall probability by adding the probabilities instead of multiplying them. 

(D) - Only considered the first draw when calculating the probability and did not factor in the second draw.
