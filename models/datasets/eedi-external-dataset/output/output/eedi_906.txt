Question: A rectangle has vertices at points \( A(2, 1) \), \( B(2, 5) \), \( C(5, 5) \), and \( D(5, 1) \). If the rectangle is reflected over the line \( y = 4 \), what are the new coordinates of point \( B \)? 

###
Answers:
(A) - \( (2, 3) \) 

(B) - \( (2, 6) \) 

(C) - \( (5, 1) \) 

(D) - \( (2, 7) \) 

###
Misconceptions:
(A) - Incorrectly calculates the distance from the reflection line, thinking it's simply subtracting from the value 

(B) - Overestimates the distance from the line of reflection, miscalculating the direction of the reflection 

(C) - Treats the point \( B \) as remaining in the same position, ignoring the effect of reflection 

(D) - Misunderstands the reflection process, adding instead of subtracting the distance
