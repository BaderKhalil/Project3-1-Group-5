Question: In an isosceles triangle, if one of the equal angles measures \( 38^{\degree} \), what is the measure of the other equal angle? ![An isosceles triangle with two equal angles each labelled with a question and the third angle labelled with \( 104^{\degree} \)]() 

###
Answers:
(A) - \( 38^{\degree} \)

(B) - \( 52^{\degree} \)

(C) - \( 76^{\degree} \)

(D) - \( 104^{\degree} \)

###
Misconceptions:
(A) - Incorrectly assumes that the equal angle must always equal the base angle.

(B) - Misunderstands the relationship between the angles, incorrectly adding instead of subtracting from \( 180^{\degree} \).

(C) - Confuses the sum of the angles in a triangle, miscalculating the angles.

(D) - Incorrectly believes the equal angles can be equal to the vertex angle.
