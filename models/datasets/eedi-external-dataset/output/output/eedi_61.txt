Question: What fraction should be indicated by the question mark? ![A number line marked with 1/3, 2/3, 1, and 4/3. The question mark is located one-third of the way between 2/3 and 1.]() 

###
Answers:
(A) - \( \frac{5}{9} \) 

(B) - \( \frac{7}{9} \) 

(C) - \( \frac{3}{4} \) 

(D) - None of these 

###
Misconceptions:
(A) - Incorrectly assumes that the distance between 2/3 and 1 can be divided into thirds but miscalculates the fraction placement. 

(B) - Recognizes the need to divide the segment but calculates incorrectly, thinking it needs to go to the next whole number. 

(C) - Misunderstands that 3/4 is the correct halfway mark instead of realizing the division is between 2/3 and 1. 

(D) - Does not see that the fraction can be interpreted as a segment of 2/3 to 1 rather than considering it as an independent measure.
