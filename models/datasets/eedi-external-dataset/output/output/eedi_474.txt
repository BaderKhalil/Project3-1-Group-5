Question: Factorise the following expression \( x^{2}+7 x+10 \)

###
Answers:
(A) - \( (x+5)(x+2) \)

(B) - Cannot be factorised

(C) - \( (x+1)(x+10) \)

(D) - \( x(x+7)+10 \)

###
Misconceptions:
(A) - Thinks the factors are reversed, confusing the order of terms that need to be multiplied to give the constant term.

(B) - Assumes the expression does not have integer factors without checking possible combinations.

(C) - Incorrectly believes that adding the numbers should equal the coefficient of the \( x^2 \) term rather than the coefficient of the \( x \) term.

(D) - Misunderstands the process of factorising and misapplies the idea by incorrectly factoring out the variable term while keeping the constant term separate.
