        Question: A survey was conducted to find out how many pets the students in a school have.

A selection of results are displayed in the table. \begin{tabular}{|c|c|c|}
\hline Number of pets & Frequency & Angle on a pie chart \\
\hline  0  & \( 5 \) & \( \bigstar \) \\
\hline 1  & \(  \) & \( 90 \degree \) \\
\hline 2  & \(  \) & \(  \) \\
\hline 3  & \( 3 \) & \(  \) \\
\hline 4 or more  & \(  \) & \(  \) \\
\hline  TOTAL  & 25  & \(  \) \\
\end{tabular} Mike wants to calculate the angle for the sector representing students with 0 pets.

Which of the following calculations would determine what replaces the star?

        ###
        Answers:
        (A) - \( \frac{5}{25} \times 360 \) 

        (B) - \( \frac{25}{360} \times 5 \) 

        (C) - \( \frac{360}{5} \times 25 \) 

        (D) - \( 5 \times 25 \) 

        ###
        Misconceptions:
        (A) - Believes the angle for a pie chart sector is calculated by determining the frequency's proportion of the total and then scaling that to 360 degrees accurately

        (B) - Believes that the total (360 degrees) should be divided by the frequency and then multiplied by the number of instances 

        (C) - Believes the angle for a pie chart sector is found by multiplying the total frequency by the value representing the result 

        (D) - Believes that to find the angle for the pie chart sector you must multiply the frequency by the total number of students surveyed
