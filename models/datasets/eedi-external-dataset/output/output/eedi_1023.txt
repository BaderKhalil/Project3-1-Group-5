Question: Consider a function machine ![Input \( 6 \rightarrow +4 \rightarrow \div 2 \rightarrow \) Output]() The input is \( 10 \). Which calculation provides the correct output?

###
Answers:
(A) - \( 10 + 4 \div 2 \)

(B) - \( 10 \div 2 + 4 \)

(C) - \( (10 + 4) \div 2 \)

(D) - \( 10 \div (2 + 4) \)

###
Misconceptions:
(A) - Believes that operations can be performed in any order without following the function machine's sequence.

(B) - Does not correctly interpret the sequence of operations in the function machine, performing them in the wrong arrangement.

(C) - Follows the operations correctly but fails to place operations in the exact sequence described by the function machine.

(D) - Confuses the operations and uses brackets incorrectly to change the order of calculations.
