Question: The graph displays the temperature, \( T \, \text{Â°C} \), recorded in a city \( h \) hours after sunrise.

Which of the following is the best estimate for the gradient of the curve when \( h=5 \)? ![The image is of a temperature-time graph. There is a tangent, drawn touching the curve precisely at \( h=5 \). The tangent intersects points (3, 15), (5, 25), and (7, 30).]() 

###
Answers:
(A) - \( 5 \) 

(B) - \( 8 \) 

(C) - \( 7.5 \) 

(D) - \( 10 \) 

###
Misconceptions:
(A) - Misunderstands that the gradient may include the use of whole numbers without considering the actual changes in value. 

(B) - Does not understand the difference between the temperature at a certain time and the rate of temperature change (gradient). 

(C) - Believes that the gradient is simply the difference in values divided by the total time rather than the specific change at the point of tangency. 

(D) - Overestimates the gradient by not applying the correct method of calculating the change in temperature over the change in time at \( h=5 \).
