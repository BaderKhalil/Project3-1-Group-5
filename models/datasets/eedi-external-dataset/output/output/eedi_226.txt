Question: This is the graph of
\[
y=2x+1
\]

According to the graph, what is the solution to:
\[
2x+1=5
\] ![Graph showing straight line with y intercept (0,1) and x intercept (-0.5,0)]() 

###
Answers:
(A) - \( x=2 \) 

(B) - \( x=3 \) 

(C) - \( x=1 \) 

(D) - \( x=0 \) 

###
Misconceptions:
(A) - Believes they need to add 1 to the right-hand side of the equation before solving for x.

(B) - Thinks that they should double the value of the right-hand side without accounting for subtraction.

(C) - Falsely assumes that the solution is derived directly from substituting values into the equation.

(D) - Thinks the solution is simply where the graph crosses the y-axis.
