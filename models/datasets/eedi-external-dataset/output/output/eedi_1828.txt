Question: In a triangle, one angle measures \( 50^{\circ} \) and another angle measures \( 70^{\circ} \). What is the measure of the third angle? 

###
Answers:
(A) - \( 60^{\circ} \) 

(B) - \( 90^{\circ} \) 

(C) - \( 40^{\circ} \) 

(D) - \( 80^{\circ} \) 

###
Misconceptions:
(A) - Incorrectly calculates by assuming the angles should complement each other rather than sum to \( 180^{\circ} \). 

(B) - Misunderstands the properties of triangle angles and thinks that there is often a right angle involved. 

(C) - Incorrectly adds the two given angles and subtracts the result from \( 360^{\circ} \) instead of \( 180^{\circ} \). 

(D) - Believes that the largest angle must be equal to the sum of the two smaller angles without recognizing the triangle angle sum property.
