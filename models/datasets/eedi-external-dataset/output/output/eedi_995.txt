Question: What is the size of each interior angle in a regular octagon? 

###
Answers:
(A) - \( 108^{\degree} \) 

(B) - \( 135^{\degree} \) 

(C) - \( 140^{\degree} \) 

(D) - \( 150^{\degree} \) 

###
Misconceptions:
(A) - Miscalculates by assuming the formula for total interior angles without considering the right number of sides. 

(B) - Thinks the number of sides is related to the interior angle instead of using \( (n-2) \times 180^{\degree} \) for the total interior angles. 

(C) - nan 

(D) - Believes the interior angles increase with more sides based on incorrect patterns.
