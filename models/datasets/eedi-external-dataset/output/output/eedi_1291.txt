Question: What should replace the circle when this expression is fully factorised? \( 12x^2 + 8x \equiv \bigstar(\triangle x + \bigcirc) \) 

###
Answers:
(A) - \( \bigcirc=2x \) 

(B) - \( \bigcirc=4 \) 

(C) - \( \bigcirc=3 \) 

(D) - \( \bigcirc=2 \) 

###
Misconceptions:
(A) - Forgets to factor out the greatest common factor completely and only factors out part of it. 

(B) - Incorrectly assumes that a factor is a simple number rather than a combination of numerical and algebraic terms.

(C) - Assumes that the remaining factor must always be a constant integer, not considering the variable part in factorisation.

(D) - Confuses the procedure of factorisation with simple arithmetic, attempting to simplify instead of factor.
