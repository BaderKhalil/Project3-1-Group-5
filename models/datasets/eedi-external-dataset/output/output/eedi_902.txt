Question: Simplify the expression:
\[
3x + 7 - 2x
\]

###
Answers:
(A) - \( x + 7 \)

(B) - \( 5x + 7 \)

(C) - \( 3 + 7x \)

(D) - \( x + 7 \)

###
Misconceptions:
(A) - Incorrectly believes that only the coefficients are combined while ignoring the constant term's contribution.

(B) - Misunderstands how to combine like terms, thinking that adding x coefficients results in addition without subtraction.

(C) - Confuses the order of operations and tries to add constants to the variable instead of collecting like terms properly.

(D) - Correct interpretation of combining terms while separating the constant.
