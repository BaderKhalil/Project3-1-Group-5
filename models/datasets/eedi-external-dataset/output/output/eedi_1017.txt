(D) - \( x > 3 \)

###
Misconceptions:

(B) - Incorrectly believes that \(2x + 3\) can be simplified by only subtracting 3 from both sides without considering the coefficient of \(x\).

(C) - Incorrectly thinks that the inequality sign flips when subtracting a number from one side.

(D) - Believes that the problem has more than one solution direction when it does not.
