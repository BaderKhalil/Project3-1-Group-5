Question: A rectangle has an area of \( 72 \mathrm{~cm}^{2} \). If the length is \( 12 \mathrm{~cm} \), what is the width of the rectangle?

###
Answers:
(A) - \( 6 \mathrm{~cm} \) 

(B) - \( 8 \mathrm{~cm} \) 

(C) - \( 12 \mathrm{~cm} \) 

(D) - \( 9 \mathrm{~cm} \) 

###
Misconceptions:
(A) - Incorrectly applies the formula for area by miscalculating the width. 

(B) - Assumes width should always be less than length without checking the area. 

(C) - Confuses the dimensions; thinks the width can be the same as the length without considering area. 

(D) - Miscalculates the width by ignoring the area constraint.
