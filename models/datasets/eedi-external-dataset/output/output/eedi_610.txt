Question: Which of the following equations represents a parabola that opens downward?

###
Answers:
(A) - \( y = -3(x-2)^{2} + 7 \) 

(B) - \( y = 4(x+1)^{2} - 10 \) 

(C) - \( y = -2x^{2} + 5x + 3 \) 

(D) - \( y = 5(x-4)^{2} + 1 \) 

###
Misconceptions:
(A) - Believes negative coefficient indicates upward direction 

(B) - Assumes all values are positive leading to a misconception about the vertex 

(C) - Incorrectly thinks all quadratic equations open in the same direction as their leading coefficient 

(D) - Thinks a positive coefficient results in downward opening of a parabola
