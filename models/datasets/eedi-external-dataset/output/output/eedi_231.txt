Question: Which of the following sketches could represent \( y=3+5x \) ?

###
Answers:
(A) - ![A straight line graph that crosses the y axis above the origin and has a positive slope.]() 

(B) - ![A straight line graph that crosses the x axis to the right of the origin and has a negative slope.]() 

(C) - ![A straight line graph that crosses the x axis to the left of the origin and has a positive slope.]() 

(D) - ![A straight line graph that crosses the x axis to the left of the origin and has a negative slope.]() 

###
Misconceptions:
(A) - nan 

(B) - Believes that a positive slope means the line falls towards the right. 

(C) - Believes that the y-intercept can be negative even if the slope is positive. 

(D) - Believes that in y=mx+c, m is the intercept while c is the slope.
