Question: Use the graph to approximate the solution to \( x^{2}+3x-4>0 \) ![A set of axes with the quadratic graph y=x^2+3x-4 drawn on.]() 

###
Answers:
(A) - \( x<1, x>-4 \)

(B) - \( -4<x<1 \)

(C) - \( x<-4, x>1 \)

(D) - \( x=1 \)

###
Misconceptions:
(A) - Misinterprets the intervals where the function is positive

(B) - Confuses positive and negative intervals when reading from the graph 

(C) - Mixes the zeros of the function with the sign of the inequalities

(D) - Assumes the inequality is true at the vertex rather than identifying the full range
