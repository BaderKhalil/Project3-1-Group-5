Question: What is the measure of angle \( x \) if angle \( y \) is 120 degrees and they are supplementary angles? ![A diagram shows two angles sharing a common vertex. One angle measured \( y \) is labelled 120 degrees and is obtained by extending one line. The other angle \( x \) is the angle right next to it on the same straight line. ]()

###
Answers:
(A) - 60 degrees 

(B) - 120 degrees 

(C) - 90 degrees 

(D) - 180 degrees 

###
Misconceptions:
(A) - Misunderstands that supplementary angles add up to 180 degrees and incorrectly subtracts from a different value. 

(B) - Confuses one angle with the measure of its supplementary angle, thinking they are the same. 

(C) - Assumes that the two angles can be right angles without considering their relationship as supplementary angles. 

(D) - Incorrectly believes that all straight angles have a measure of 180 degrees without relating to the specific supplementary angles given.
