Question: A line has a gradient of \( 3 \) and passes through the point \( (2,5) \). What is its equation? 

###
Answers:
(A) - \( y=3x+3 \) 

(B) - \( y=3x+5 \) 

(C) - \( y=3x+6 \) 

(D) - \( y=5x+3 \) 

###
Misconceptions:
(A) - Believes the y-intercept is calculated incorrectly, using the point's coordinates without substituting into the line equation. 

(B) - Believes c, in y=mx+c, is simply the y-value of the point provided, ignoring the need to calculate based on the line's gradient from the point. 

(C) - Confuses the calculation of the y-intercept by adding the gradient times the x-value of the point instead of solving for c correctly. 

(D) - Assumes that changing the gradient from 3 to 5 requires a different slope entirely, incorrectly applying the y-value to the equation.
