        Question: Sarah and Alex are discussing properties of a geometric sequence.

Sarah states that the following sequence is geometric: \( 3, 6, 12, 24, 48, \ldots \)

Alex claims that the following sequence is geometric: \( 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, \ldots \)

Who is correct?

        ###
        Answers:
        (A) - Only Sarah 

        (B) - Only Alex

        Misconceptions:
        (A) - Does not recognize that for geometric sequences, each term must be multiplied by the same non-zero factor to get the next term. 

        (B) - Does not recognize that for geometric sequences, each term must be multiplied by the same non-zero factor to get the next term.

        (C) - Does not recognize that for geometric sequences, each term must be multiplied by the same non-zero factor to get the next term.

        (D) - Does not recognize that for geometric sequences, each term must be multiplied by the same non-zero factor to get the next term.
