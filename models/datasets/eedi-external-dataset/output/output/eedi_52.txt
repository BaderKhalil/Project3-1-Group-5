Question: What is the simplified form of the following expression?
\(
2(x + 5) - 3(x - 2)

###
Answers:
(A) - \( -x + 16 \)

(B) - \( 5x + 10 \)

(C) - \( x + 2 \)

(D) - \( -x + 4 \)

###
Misconceptions:
(A) - Incorrectly combines like terms or miscalculates the constants adjusted by the coefficients.

(B) - Fails to distribute correctly and adds without regard to combining the like terms.

(C) - Ignores the effect of the negative sign on \( (x - 2) \) during distribution.

(D) - Misunderstands the distribution of constants and incorrect arithmetic leading to a wrong calculation.
