Question: Which of the following quadrilaterals has the highest order of rotational symmetry?

###
Answers:
(A) - ![Rectangle]() 

(B) - ![Parallelogram]() 

(C) - ![Rhombus]() 

(D) - ![Square]() 

###
Misconceptions:
(A) - Believes that rectangles have high symmetry, but underestimates that squares have a higher order. 

(B) - Thinks parallelograms have comparable symmetry to squares, but they lack a crucial level of rotational symmetry.

(C) - Assumes rhombuses have the same symmetry as squares without realizing the order is lower. 

(D) - nan
