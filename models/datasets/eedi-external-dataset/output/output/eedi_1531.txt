Question: These two rectangles are similar (not drawn to scale). What should replace the star? ![Two rectangles. The larger one has a width of 10 cm and a height of 15 cm. The smaller rectangle has a width of 6 cm and a height marked with a star.]() 

###
Answers:
(A) - \( 9 \mathrm{~cm} \)

(B) - \( 12 \mathrm{~cm} \)

(C) - \( 8.5 \mathrm{~cm} \)

(D) - Not enough information 

###
Misconceptions:
(A) - Thinks the larger rectangle's height should be halved for the smaller rectangle, neglecting the scale factor.

(B) - Does not understand that the aspect ratio of similar shapes must remain consistent.

(C) - Mistakenly thinks a random number can be chosen to represent the height without considering proportionality.

(D) - Does not correctly apply the properties of similar shapes to calculate the unknown dimension.
