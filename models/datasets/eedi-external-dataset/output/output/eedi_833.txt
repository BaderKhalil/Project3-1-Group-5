Question: A square with vertices at \( (1,1) \), \( (1,3) \), \( (3,3) \), and \( (3,1) \) is reflected over the line \( y = -x \). What are the new coordinates of the vertex \( (3,1) \)?

###
Answers:
(A) - \( (-1,3) \)

(B) - \( (-3,-1) \)

(C) - \( (-1,-3) \)

(D) - \( (-1,-1) \)

###
Misconceptions:
(A) - Fails to correctly apply the reflection transformation 

(B) - Misunderstands how to negate coordinates when reflecting over the line \( y = -x \)

(C) - Fails to account for where the reflection lands; incorrectly reflects vertically instead of across the diagonal 

(D) - nan
