###
Answers:
(A) - \( 60 \)

(B) - \( 40 \)

(D) - \( 20 \)

###
Misconceptions:
(A) - Misunderstands the calculation of percentages, mistakenly thinks \( 150\% \) means to take \( 60\% \) of \( 40 \).

(B) - Incorrectly believes that the percentage does not change the value and assumes \( 150\% \) is the same as \( 100\% \).

(C) - Correctly calculates that \( 150\% \) implies \( 1.5 \times 40 \), leading to the right answer. 

(D) - Does not know how to calculate percentages, resulting in an unreasonable figure that is far less than \( 40 \).
