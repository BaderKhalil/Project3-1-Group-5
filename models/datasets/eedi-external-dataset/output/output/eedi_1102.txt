City A: \( -3.5^{\circ} C \)
City B: \( -1.2^{\circ} C \)
City C: \( -4.7^{\circ} C \)
Arrange their temperatures in ascending order, starting with the coldest 

###
Answers:
(A) - \( 1^{\text {st }} \) City C

(D) - \( 1^{\text {st }} \) City C
\( 2^{\text {nd }} \) City B
\( 3^{\text {rd }} \) City A

(A) - Believes that a smaller number (more negative) can still be greater if the absolute value is larger without recognizing the context of temperature. 

(B) - Incorrectly assumes all negative numbers are colder in their absolute terms and does not account for their values appropriately. 

(C) - Thinks that temperatures close to zero are the coldest, disregarding the need to compare negative values accurately. 

(D) - nan
