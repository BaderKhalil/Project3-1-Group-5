Question: What is the measure of angle \( x \) if angle \( y \) measures 75 degrees and angles \( x \) and \( y \) are alternate interior angles? ![Image showing two parallel lines cut by a transversal creating two distinct angles, where angle y is labeled as 75 degrees, and angle x is vertically opposite to the angle formed on the opposite side of the transversal.](https://example.com)

###
Answers:
(A) - 75 degrees 

(B) - 105 degrees 

(C) - 90 degrees 

(D) - 45 degrees 

###
Misconceptions:
(A) - Confuses alternate interior angles with corresponding angles 

(B) - Mistakes the relationship between alternate interior angles and assumes a complementary angle 

(C) - Confuses the angle with a right angle due to absence of explicit angle measures 

(D) - Confuses alternate interior angles with angles on a straight line
