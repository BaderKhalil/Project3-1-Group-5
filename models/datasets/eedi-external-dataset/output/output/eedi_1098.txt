Question: STEP \( 4 \)

What is the simplest form of the following expression?
\(
\begin{aligned}
& \frac{4 x^2 - 16}{2 x} \div \frac{2 x^2 - 8}{4} \\
= & \frac{4 x^2 - 16}{2 x} \times \frac{4}{2 x^2 - 8}
\end{aligned}
\)

###
Answers:
(A) - \( \frac{8(x-2)}{x(x-4)} \) 

(B) - \( \frac{2(x+4)}{x} \) 

(C) - \( \frac{4}{x-2} \) 

(D) - \( \frac{2(x-4)}{x} \) 

###
Misconceptions:
(A) - Misapplies the distributive property, incorrectly factoring and simplifying multiple terms together. 

(B) - Ignores the multiple factors in the original terms and only simplifies numeric coefficients. 

(C) - Mistakenly simplifies an algebraic fraction without recognizing common factors and reduces incorrectly. 

(D) - Correctly identifies and simplifies the common factors in the expression.
