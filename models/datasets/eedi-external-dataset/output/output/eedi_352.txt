Question: This is a part of the table of values for the equation \(y=x^{2}-3\) 
\begin{tabular}{|l|l|}
\hline\( x \) & \( 5 \) \\
\hline\( y \) & \( \bigstar \) \\
\hline
\end{tabular} What should replace the star? 

###
Answers:
(A) - \( 22 \) 

(B) - \( -15 \) 

(C) - \( 0 \) 

(D) - \( -8 \) 

###
Misconceptions:
(A) - Believes \(x^2\) operates independently of the constant adjustment in the equation. 

(B) - Believes that subtracting from a positive result yields a negative outcome without considering the square. 

(C) - Believes that the square of a positive number plus a negative constant can yield zero.

(D) - Believes that subtracting a larger number from a smaller one results in a positive value.
