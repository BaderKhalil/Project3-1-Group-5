Question: Which of the following expressions is the correct expansion of \( (2x + 3)(x - 5) \)?

###
Answers:
(A) - \( 2x^{2} - 7x - 15 \)

(B) - \( 2x^{2} + x - 15 \)

(C) - \( 2x^{2} - 10x + 3x - 15 \)

(D) - \( 2x^{2} - 7x + 15 \)

###
Misconceptions:
(A) - Incorrectly combines the constant terms with the wrong coefficients from each binomial.

(B) - Misjudges the interaction between terms, leading to the wrong coefficient for \( x \).

(C) - Correctly applies the distribution but fails to combine like terms properly, tending to not finalize the expression.

(D) - Misplaces the sign for the constant in the final expression and misunderstands the distribution.
