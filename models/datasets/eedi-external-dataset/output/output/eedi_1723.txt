Question: What expression does the star replace when fully expanding and simplifying?
\(
x(x+3)(x-1) \equiv x^{3} \star x^{2} \diamond x
\)

###
Answers:
(A) - \( \star=-3 \) 

(B) - \( \star=+3 \) 

(C) - \( \star=+0 \) 
     
(D) - \( \star=+2 \) 

###
Misconceptions:
(A) - Thinks the constant from the expanded form only reflects the sum of constants in the brackets.

(B) - Considers that the multiplication of mixed signs only yields a positive value.

(C) - Fails to account for all terms in the product and neglects the multiplication of each term with each other.

(D) - Believes the constant term simplifies directly without considering the negative impacts of the expanded terms.
