Question: If angle \( b \) is twice angle \( c \) and angle \( c \) is \( 30^{\degree} \), what is the value of angle \( b \)? ![Diagram showing angles labeled with b and c, showing relationship between them]()

###
Answers:
(A) - \( 30^{\degree} \)

(B) - \( 60^{\degree} \)

(C) - \( 90^{\degree} \)

(D) - \( 15^{\degree} \)

###
Misconceptions:
(A) - Thinks that angle \( b \) is equal to angle \( c \) and does not apply the relationship given. 

(B) - Correctly uses the relationship but does not account for the doubling of angle \( c \).

(C) - Misunderstands the relationship and assumes \( b \) is a right angle without calculations.

(D) - Incorrectly calculates the relationship by halving instead of doubling angle \( c \).
