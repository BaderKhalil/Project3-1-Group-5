Question: What is the total surface area of a cylinder with a radius of 3 cm and a height of 5 cm? 

###
Answers:
(A) - \( 2\pi(3)(5) + 2\pi(3^2) \) 

(B) - \( 2\pi(3)(5) + \pi(3^2) \) 

(C) - \( \pi(3)(5) + 2\pi(3^2) \) 

(D) - \( \pi(3^2) \times 5 \) 

###
Misconceptions:
(A) - Misunderstands the components needed for surface area by omitting one of the circular bases 

(B) - Correctly identifies both circular bases and lateral surface area 

(C) - Incorrectly calculates surface area by mixing surface area components 

(D) - Confuses surface area with volume, using only the area of one base multiplied by height
