Question: A survey was conducted to find out how many pets students have. The table below shows some results. 

\begin{tabular}{|c|c|c|}
\hline Number of pets & Frequency & Angle on a pie chart \\
\hline  0  & \( 5 \) & \(  \) \\
\hline 1  & \( 8 \) & \(  \) \\
\hline 2  & \( 7 \) & \(  \bigstar \) \\
\hline 3  & \( 2 \) & \(  \) \\
\hline 4 or more  & \(  \) & \(  \) \\
\hline  TOTAL  & 30  & \(  \) \\
\end{tabular} Mark wants to calculate the angle for the number of students who have 2 pets. What should replace the star?

###
Answers:
(A) - \( 84^\circ \) 

(B) - \( 60^\circ \) 

(C) - \( 28^\circ \) 

(D) - Not enough information 

###
Misconceptions:
(A) - Believes that to find the angle for a pie chart, you can just multiply the frequency by the number of sections in the chart. 

(B) - Believes each pet category takes an equal share of the circle regardless of frequency. 

(C) - Believes that the angle is calculated simply by dividing the frequency by the total and multiplying by \( 360^\circ \). 

(D) - Believes that there needs to be more data provided in order to calculate the angle.
