Question: What is the equation of the curve shown? ![A set of axes with a quadratic graph drawn on. The graph is y=x^2 translated 1 square to the right and 3 squares up.]() 

###
Answers:
(A) - \( y=(x-1)^{2}+3 \) 

(B) - \( y=(x+1)^{2}+3 \) 

(C) - \( y=(x-1)^{2}-3 \) 

(D) - \( y=(x+1)^{2}-3 \) 

###
Misconceptions:
(A) - Believes that in completed square form, the x co-ordinate of the turning point has the same sign as the constant in the brackets. 

(B) - Believes the graph shifts to the right instead of to the left for the negative shift in x. 

(C) - Believes that the vertical shift in the graph has no effect when translating the curve upward. 

(D) - Believes a positive y-intercept indicates a downward shift instead of an upward shift.
