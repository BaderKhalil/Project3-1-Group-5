Question: When completing the square for the expression, what value should be placed in the box?  
\[
x^{2}+8x \boxed{?}
\] 

###
Answers:
(A) - 16 

(B) - 14 

(C) - 8 

(D) - 12 

###
Misconceptions:
(A) - Correctly identifies the square of half the coefficient of x but fails to apply it to the original expression. 

(B) - Incorrectly believes that \( b \) in the form (x + a)² + b can be found by simply adding the coefficients without squaring. 

(C) - Mistakenly uses the original coefficient as the value instead of calculating half of it. 

(D) - Thinks that the square constant is achieved by just adding the x's coefficient directly without proper consideration of squaring.
