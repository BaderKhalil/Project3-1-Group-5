Question: What is the size of the angle marked on the protractor? ![A protractor showing a measurement of an angle in the second quadrant, where one line is in line with 180 degrees and the other is slightly less than 90 degrees.]
 

###
Answers:
(A) - \( 75^{\circ} \) 

(B) - \( 200^{\circ} \) 

(C) - \( 150^{\circ} \) 

(D) - \( 95^{\circ} \) 

###
Misconceptions:
(A) - Misinterprets the location of the angle as acute instead of obtuse. 

(B) - Correct scale but incorrectly adds an additional 90 degrees to the reading due to misunderstanding the quadrant system.

(C) - Misreads the protractor leading to confusion between acute and obtuse angles.

(D) - Reads angle from the wrong reference point on the protractor, thus miscalculating the value.
