Question: When calculating the volume of this cylinder, which of the following measurements is unnecessary? ![A cylinder with radius 4cm and height 10cm.]() 

###
Answers:
(A) - \( 4 \mathrm{~cm} \)

(B) - \( 10 \mathrm{~cm} \)

(C) - \( 8 \mathrm{~cm} \)

(D) - \( \pi \)

###
Misconceptions:
(A) - Thinks the radius is not relevant because they only consider the height for volume.

(B) - Believes height alone is sufficient for volume without considering the radius.

(C) - Incorrectly assumes another arbitrary measurement is needed rather than knowing only radius and height are crucial.

(D) - Confuses the use of \(\pi\) as being a physical measurement rather than a necessary part of the volume formula.
