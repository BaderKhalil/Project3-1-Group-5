Question: Lisa claims that when she factorises \( x^{2} + 6x + 8 \), she looks for two numbers that multiply to give \( 8 \) and add to give \( -6 \). Mark says that for \( x^{2} - 9x + 20 \), he needs two numbers that multiply to give \( 20 \) and add to give \( -9 \). Who is correct?

###
Answers:
(A) - Only Lisa 

(B) - Only Mark 

(C) - Both Lisa and Mark 

(D) - Neither is correct 

###
Misconceptions:
(A) - Believes the signs of the numbers should be opposite when factorising, leading to incorrect product and sum expectations. 

(B) - Fails to consider that the sum of the roots must be positive for a quadratic with a negative middle term. 

(C) - Assumes both are correct without checking the conditions for factorisation are met. 

(D) - Recognises that both have incorrect assumptions regarding the numbers they need for factorisation.
