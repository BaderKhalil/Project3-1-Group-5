Question: Maria and Jake are trying to solve the equation:
\(2(y + 3) = 14\)

Maria claims that a correct next step could be: \(y + 3 = 7\)

Jake thinks that a correct next step could be: \(2y + 6 = 14\)

Who is correct? 

###
Answers:
(A) - Only Maria 

(B) - Only Jake 

(C) - Both Maria and Jake 

(D) - Neither is correct 

###
Misconceptions:
(A) - Overlooks the need to divide both sides by 2 correctly after distributing. 

(B) - Underestimates the implications of distributing the 2, mistakenly thinking the equation can be simplified without adjusting both sides. 

(C) - Fails to recognize that both operations must directly lead to a different point in solving the equation correctly. 

(D) - Does not realize that isolating the variable incorrectly by skipping necessary algebraic steps leads to an invalid solution.
