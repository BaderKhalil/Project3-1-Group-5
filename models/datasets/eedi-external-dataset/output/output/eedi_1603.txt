Question: \[
2, 5, 8, 11, 14, \ldots
\]

When calculating the nth-term rule of this sequence, what should replace the star? nth-term rule: ![\( \hat{\omega}^{n} \)]() 

###
Answers:
(A) - \( 2 \) 

(B) - \( 3 \) 

(C) - \( 4 \) 

(D) - \( 1 \) 

###
Misconceptions:
(A) - When finding the nth term of a linear sequence, thinks the first term is the total output rather than identifying the common difference. 

(B) - Incorrectly identifies the common difference as the starting point of the sequence rather than the amount added with each step. 

(C) - Thinks the common difference should be the same as the last increment of the sequence, failing to see the pattern accurately. 

(D) - Believes the addition in the sequence decreases, resulting in misunderstanding the pattern of the sequence.
