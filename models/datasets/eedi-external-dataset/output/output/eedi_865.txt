Question: Which of the following equations represents a linear function with a negative slope? 

###
Answers:
(A) - \( y = -2x + 3 \) 

(B) - \( y = 5x + 1 \) 

(C) - \( y = -x - 4 \) 

(D) - \( y = 3x - 2 \) 

###
Misconceptions:
(A) - Believes that a negative coefficient in front of x indicates a decreasing slope 

(B) - Thinks that all linear functions have to show a decrease if they have any negative terms 

(C) - Misunderstands that the addition of a negative constant term can change the behavior of the graph 

(D) - Incorrectly believes that the sign of the slope is independent of the sign of the constant term
