Question: In the diagram, PQ : QR \(= 2: 5\). What is the length of segment PQ? ![A line that begins with point P, ends with point R, and has point Q in between. The entire length of the line measures 70 m.]()

###
Answers:
(A) - \( 10 \mathrm{~m} \)

(B) - \( 20 \mathrm{~m} \)

(C) - \( 14 \mathrm{~m} \)

(D) - \( 28 \mathrm{~m} \)

###
Misconceptions:
(A) - Errors in scaling the ratio by not considering the complete division of the total length.

(B) - Fails to recognize the order of segments in the ratio leading to calculating the wrong segment.

(C) - Calculates one part of the ratio without accounting for the total number of parts.

(D) - nan
