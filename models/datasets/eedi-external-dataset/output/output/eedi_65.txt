Question: Joanna is trying to solve the quadratic equation using the quadratic formula.
\(
x^{2} - 3x - 4 = 0
\)

What value should be placed in the triangle? ![The image shows the structure of the quadratic formula. It says plus or minus the square root, and the triangle is the first thing after the square root sign, with a minus sign after it.]() 

###
Answers:
(A) - \( 25 \) 

(B) - \( 49 \) 

(C) - \( 9 \) 

(D) - \( 16 \) 

###
Misconceptions:
(A) - Misunderstands the relationship between the coefficients and the discriminant, thinking it is always the sum of squares of numbers. 

(B) - Confuses the discriminant with the square of the linear coefficient rather than correctly applying it from \(b^2 - 4ac\).

(C) - Incorrectly applies the quadratic formula, thinking that the discriminant has to do with doubling values instead of proper coefficient application.

(D) - nan
