Question: Tom has a quadratic function represented in vertex form \( y = (\boldsymbol{x} - \boldsymbol{a})^{2} + \boldsymbol{b} \). If the vertex of the parabola is located at \( (3, -4) \), what is the value of \( \boldsymbol{b} \)? 

###
Answers:
(A) - \( -3 \)

(B) - \( 4 \)

(C) - \( -4 \)

(D) - \( 3 \)

###
Misconceptions:
(A) - Believes the y-coordinate of the vertex is obtained by subtracting instead of observing the vertex directly.
 
(B) - Incorrectly thinks that the vertex's \(y\)-coordinate should always be positive.

(C) - nan 

(D) - Misunderstands the coordinate system and thinks the coordinates of the vertex need to be swapped.
