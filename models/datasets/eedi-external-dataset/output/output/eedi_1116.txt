Question: Which of the following function machines correctly represents the operation on the input variable "x"?

###
Answers:
(A) - ![2 function machines both with 3 rectangles. The first function machine has "x" written inside the first rectangle on the left and "input" written above it; it has "✕ 3" written inside the next rectangle, and the final rectangle on the right has "output" written above it and "3x" written inside it. The first function machine has "x" written inside the first rectangle and "input" above it; it has "✕ 3" written inside the next rectangle, and the final rectangle on the right has "output" written above it and "x + 3" written inside it.]

(B) - ![2 function machines both with 3 rectangles. The first function machine has "x" written inside the first rectangle on the left and "input" written above it; it has "−2" written inside the next rectangle, and the final rectangle on the right has "output" written above it and "x − 2" written inside it. The second function machine has "x" written inside the first rectangle on the left and "input" above it; it has "✕ 3" written inside the next rectangle, and the final rectangle on the right has "output" written above it and "3x" written inside it.]

(C) - ![2 function machines both with 3 rectangles. The first function machine has "x" written inside the first rectangle on the left and "input" written above it; it has "✕ 3" written inside the next rectangle, and the final rectangle on the right has "output" written above it and "x + 3" written inside it. The second function machine has "x" written inside the first rectangle on the left and "input" above it; it has "−2" written inside the next rectangle, and the final rectangle on the right has "output" written above it and "x − 2" written inside it.]

(D) - ![2 function machines both with 3 rectangles.

Misconceptions:
(A) - This option misrepresents the output of the function machine, failing to account for the correct algebraic transformation. 

(B) - This option correctly describes a function with more than one operation but does not produce the same output as the first function machine with the description.

(C) - This option misrepresents the output of the function machine, incorrectly suggesting a different algebraic relationship.

(D) - This option contains a mistake in the representation of function operations, leading to an invalid output.
