Question: Solve for \( x \) in the equation:

\[
(x-5)(x+2)=0
\] \( x=\bigstar \) or \( x=-2 \) 

###
Answers:
(A) - \( 5 \) 

(B) - \( -5 \) 

(C) - \( -2 \) 

(D) - \( 0 \) 

###
Misconceptions:
(A) - Believes that the solution from the factor can be directly taken as is without considering the signs. 

(B) - Confuses the operation of sign placement in factorized expressions, incorrectly assuming both solutions are negative. 

(C) - Correctly identifies one solution, potentially missing the other due to misunderstanding the factoring process. 

(D) - Believes that all quadratic factorizations will yield a solution of zero.
