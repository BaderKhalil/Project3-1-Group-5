Question: This graph depicts the height of a plant over several weeks.

What is the height of the plant after \( 6 \) weeks? ![A graph showing time (weeks) on the horizontal axis and height (cm) on the vertical axis. The graph starts at (0,5), rises linearly to (6,20), then continues to rise towards (12,30).]() 

###
Answers:
(A) - \( 10 \mathrm{~cm} \) 

(B) - \( 20 \mathrm{~cm} \) 

(C) - \( 15 \mathrm{~cm} \) 

(D) - \( 25 \mathrm{~cm} \) 

###
Misconceptions:
(A) - Calculates incorrectly by averaging growth over the whole period instead of interval at 6 weeks.

(B) - nan

(C) - Misunderstands linear growth and averages values instead of taking direct measurement.

(D) - Assumes an exponential growth pattern rather than the linear trend shown in the graph.
