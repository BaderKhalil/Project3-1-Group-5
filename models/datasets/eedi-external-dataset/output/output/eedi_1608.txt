Question: ![Diagram of a number line with points labeled -3, 0, and +2, showing an arrow moving from -3 up to -1]() Which calculation represents the movement along the number line?

###
Answers:
(A) - \( -3 + 2 = -1 \)

(B) - \( -1 + 3 = 2 \)

(C) - \( 0 - 3 = -3 \)

(D) - \( -3 - 1 = -4 \)

###
Misconceptions:
(A) - Uinterprets the addition of two negatives incorrectly as resulting in a positive movement on the number line.

(B) - Confuses the addition of numbers with moving right on a number line, not recognizing when starting from a negative number changes the outcome.

(C) - Misunderstands the representation of the negative part of the number line, believing zero is needed to subtract a negative.

(D) - Incorrectly adds a negative number in a way that implies moving further left on the number line rather than calculating the correct sum.
