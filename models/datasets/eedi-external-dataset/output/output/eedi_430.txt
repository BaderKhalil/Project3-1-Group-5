Question: What is the y-intercept of the line represented by the equation \(3x + 2y = 12\)?

###
Answers:
(A) \(6\) 

(B) \(4\) 

(C) \(-4\) 

(D) \(0\) 

###
Misconceptions:
(A) - Misunderstands the process of finding the y-intercept, thinking it is obtained from the coefficient of y rather than isolating y in the equation.

(B) - Correctly identifies the intercept after rearranging to the form \(y = mx + b\).

(C) - Incorrectly assumes the y-intercept involves a negative value without proper calculation from the equation.

(D) - Incorrectly assumes the y-intercept is zero without considering the values from the equation.
