Question: Mark is trying to rewrite the equation of the curve in the form \( y=(\boldsymbol{x}+\boldsymbol{p})^{2}+\boldsymbol{q} \). If the original equation is \( y = 2x^2 + 8x + 5 \), what is the value of \( \boldsymbol{p} \) ? 

###
Answers:
(A) - \( -4 \)

(B) - \( -2 \)

(C) - \( 2 \)

(D) - \( 4 \)

###
Misconceptions:
(A) - Believes that the coefficient of \( x \) in the original equation directly gives the value of \( p \) without considering completing the square.

(B) - In correctly applying completing the square, confuses the division of the coefficient by 2 as negation instead of halving it.

(C) - Misunderstands the relationship between the vertex form and the standard form of a quadratic equation, leading to an incorrect positive value.

(D) - Confuses the transformation of the graph that applies a positive shift to the x-coordinate instead of a negative one.
