Question: \( -3n < \frac{n}{3} \) For what values of \( n \) is the statement above true?

###
Answers:
(A) - when \( n \) is positive 

(B) - when \( n \) is negative 

(C) - never true 

(D) - only when \( n = 0 \) 

###
Misconceptions:
(A) - Assumes that the inequality behaves the same way when \( n \) is positive without analyzing the effect of multiplication by a negative number.

(B) - Assumes that all negative numbers will satisfy the inequality without checking specific cases.

(C) - Incorrectly concludes that the statement holds for no values of \( n \).

(D) - Fails to recognize that \( n = 0 \) does not satisfy the inequality.
