Question: Which of the following graphs best illustrates the relationship between the amount of work done and the time taken, assuming a constant power output?

###
Answers:
(A) - ![A straight line graph starting at the origin and travelling right with a positive gradient.]()

(B) - ![A downward-sloping straight line graph starting partway up the y-axis and traveling right toward the x-axis.]() 

(C) - ![A curved graph that starts at the origin. As you move right, it travels steeply up and then gradually levels off.]() 

(D) - ![An upward-curved graph that starts low and travels right, steeply rising and never leveling off.]() 

###
Misconceptions:
(A) - Thinks more work always means less time taken without considering power output. 

(B) - Assumes that as time increases, the amount of work done decreases due to constant power misunderstanding. 

(C) - nan 

(D) - Believes that increasing time will always lead to an infinite increase in work done without factoring in power limits.
