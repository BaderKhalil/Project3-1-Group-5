Question: How can you eliminate the \( x \) in the following pairs of simultaneous equations?
 Pair \( 1 \)
\(
\begin{array}{l}
3 x + 4 y = 18 \\
3 x - 2 y = 6
\end{array}
\) 
Pair \( 2 \)
\(
\begin{array}{l}
5 x + 4 y = 20 \\
5 x - 3 y = 10
\end{array}
\) 

###
Answers:
(A) - Subtract Pair \( 1 \)
Add Pair \( 2 \) 

(B) - Add Pair \( 1 \)
Subtract Pair \( 2 \) 

(C) - Add Pair \( 1 \)
Add Pair \( 2 \) 

(D) - Subtract Pair \( 1 \)
Subtract Pair \( 2 \) 

###
Misconceptions:
(A) - Believes that when eliminating a variable, if the coefficients of the variable that needs to be eliminated are the same, we subtract equations incorrectly assuming that would lead to elimination.

(B) - Believes that simply adding and subtracting pairs leads to elimination without considering the need for matching coefficients and signs.

(C) - Believes that adding the equations directly leads to the elimination of the variable regardless of their structure.

(D) - nan
