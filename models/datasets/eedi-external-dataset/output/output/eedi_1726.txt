Question: What distance should be labeled as \( \color{green}\bigstar \)? ![A diagram showing a trapezoid. The top base is labeled \( 2x+5 \), one leg is labeled \( 3 \), the bottom base is \( 4x \), and the other leg is labeled \( 2x-1 \]. There is a green star marked on the left leg at the bottom of the trapezoid.]() 

###
Answers:
(A) - \( 2x + 3 \) 

(B) - \( 3x - 1 \) 

(C) - \( 4x - (2x + 5) \) 

(D) - Not enough information 

###
Misconceptions:
(A) - Confuses the relationship between the sides and bases of a trapezoid 

(B) - Incorrectly applies the properties of a trapezoid's sides 

(C) - nan 

(D) - Does not recognize how to derive missing lengths based on given dimensions
