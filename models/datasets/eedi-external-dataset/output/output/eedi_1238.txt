Question: A theater charges a fixed price of \( \$15 \) for a ticket plus an additional \( \$2.50 \) for each popcorn purchased. Which of the following expressions correctly represents the total cost, \( C \), of attending the theater with \( \boldsymbol{p} \) popcorns?

###
Answers:
(A) - \( \mathrm{C}=15 + 2.50 \mathrm{~p} \) 

(B) - \( \mathrm{C}=2.50 \mathrm{~p}+15.00 \) 

(C) - \( \mathrm{C}=2.50(15+p) \) 

(D) - \( \mathrm{C}=17.50 \mathrm{~p} \) 

###
Misconceptions:
(A) - nan 

(B) - Correctly calculates the formula but doesn't recognize the importance of the order of additive components in situations with a fixed cost.

(C) - Makes an order of operations mistake, incorrectly grouping constants and variables when writing a formula from a situation.

(D) - Misunderstands the concept of additional costs and incorrectly assumes that the total cost is just based on the number of popcorns with no fixed entry fee.
