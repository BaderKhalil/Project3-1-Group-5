Question: Alex and Jamie are discussing the slopes of two lines. 
Alex claims that the lines represented by \( y = 2x + 3 \) and \( y = -2x + 5 \) are parallel. 
Jamie argues that the lines represented by \( y = 4x - 1 \) and \( y = 4x + 6 \) are also parallel. 
Who is correct? 

###
Answers:
(A) - Only Alex 

(B) - Only Jamie 

(C) - Both Alex and Jamie 

(D) - Neither is correct 

###
Misconceptions:
(A) - Believes that lines with opposite slopes can be parallel  

(B) - Believes that lines are parallel only if they have the same slope 

(C) - Assumes that having the same slope OR y-intercept is sufficient for lines to be parallel 

(D) - Assumes both lines must have different slopes for parallelism
