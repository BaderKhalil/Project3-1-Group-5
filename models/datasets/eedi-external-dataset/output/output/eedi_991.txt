Question: What is the area of this trapezoid?
![Trapezoid with top base length 4cm, bottom base length 6cm, and height 5cm.]() 

###
Answers:
(A) - \( 25 \mathrm{~cm}^{2} \) 

(B) - \( 20 \mathrm{~cm}^{2} \) 

(C) - \( 20 \mathrm{~cm}^{2} \) 

(D) - \( 15 \mathrm{~cm}^{2} \) 

###
Misconceptions:
(A) - Incorrectly adds the lengths of the bases and multiplies by height without dividing by 2. 

(B) - Correctly finds the average of the bases but then mistakenly multiplies by the height directly without applying the proper trapezoidal area formula. 

(C) - Has correctly used the formula for area of a trapezoid, \( \frac{(b_1 + b_2) \times h}{2} \). 

(D) - Uses the average of the bases but incorrectly calculates the height or fails to divide by 2.
