Question: Factorise the following expression, if possible:
\(
x^{2} - 6x
\) 

###
Answers:
(A) - \( (x - 3)(x - 3) \) 

(B) - \( x(x - 6) \) 

(C) - \( (x + 3)(x - 3) \) 

(D) - Does not factorise 

###
Misconceptions:
(A) - When factorising a quadratic expression, incorrectly assumes a double bracket factorisation, missing the common factor. 

(B) - nan 

(C) - When factorising a quadratic expression, incorrectly assumes the existence of a non-existing constant term (squared term) that would not produce this factorisation.

(D) - nan
