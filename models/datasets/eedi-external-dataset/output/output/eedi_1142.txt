Question: What should replace the star in this expression? \( x^{2} + 6x \equiv (x + \bigstar)^{2} - c \)

###
Answers:
(A) - \(\bigstar = +3 \)

(B) - \(\bigstar = +6 \)

(C) - \(\bigstar = +2 \)

(D) - \(\bigstar = +4 \)

###
Misconceptions:
(A) - Incorrectly thinks that the number inside the bracket is half the coefficient of the x-term 

(B) - Confuses completing the square with directly taking the coefficient of x as the value in the bracket 

(C) - Incorrectly believes that dividing the coefficient of x by a smaller value than 2 is necessary 

(D) - Confuses the completion process by adding an incorrect value which does not align with half the coefficient of x
