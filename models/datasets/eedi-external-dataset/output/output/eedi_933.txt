Question: Sarah and Mark are discussing points relative to the line 
\[
y = -\frac{1}{2}x + 4
\]

Sarah claims that the point \( (2,3) \) lies on the line \( \boldsymbol{y} = -\frac{1}{2} \boldsymbol{x} + 4 \)

Mark claims that the point \( (8,0) \) lies on the line \( \boldsymbol{y} = -\frac{1}{2} \boldsymbol{x} + 4 \)

Who is correct?

###
Answers:
(A) - Only Sarah 

(B) - Only Mark 

(C) - Both Sarah and Mark 

(D) - Neither is correct 

###
Misconceptions:
(A) - Believes that substituting x into the equation correctly produces the corresponding y value 

(B) - Incorrectly assumes that substituting the point into the equation yields a true statement 

(C) - Thinks both points can satisfy the equation without calculation 

(D) - Misunderstands how to substitute points into the equation to verify their validity
