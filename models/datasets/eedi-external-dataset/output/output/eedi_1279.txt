Question: Here are the first \( 5 \) terms of a sequence ![\( \begin{array}{lllll}2 & 5 & 8 & 11 & \ldots\end{array} \)]() What position in the sequence is the number \( 26 ? \) 

###
Answers:
(A) - \( 8 \) 

(B) - \( 22 \) 

(C) - \( 9 \) 

(D) - \( 10 \) 

###
Misconceptions:
(A) - Believes the sequence resets after reaching a certain number and starts counting again. 

(B) - Miscalculates by dividing the term value by the common difference and adds the starting position incorrectly.

(C) - Incorrectly assumes that each term can be found by doubling the previous term.

(D) - Thinks the term value corresponds directly to counting the sequence multiples without considering the starting term.
