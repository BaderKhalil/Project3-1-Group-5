Question: A displacement-time graph illustrates Emily's journey over a period of \( 12 \) seconds. 

During this time, she maintains a steady speed of \( 4 \mathrm{~m/s} \).

What distance should replace the star? ![A graph showing Time in seconds on the x axis and Distance in metres on the y axis. A straight line is drawn from the origin to the point (12, \(\bigstar \))]() 

###
Answers:
(A) - \( 48 \mathrm{~m} \) 

(B) - \( 12 \mathrm{~m} \) 

(C) - \( 24 \mathrm{~m} \) 

(D) - \( 36 \mathrm{~m} \) 

###
Misconceptions:
(A) - Believes distance is calculated by multiplying speed and time correctly, but misinterprets the formula for a constant speed scenario. 

(B) - Believes speed must be added to time to find distance instead of using multiplication. 

(C) - nan 

(D) - Believes that distance cannot exceed a limit since time is fixed, misunderstanding the linear relationship in displacement-time graphs.
