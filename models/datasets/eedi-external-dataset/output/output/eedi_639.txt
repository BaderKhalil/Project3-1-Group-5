Question: What number should replace the box to make the equation true? \( 475 - \square = 200 \) 

###
Answers:
(A) - \( 275 \) 

(B) - \( 375 \) 

(C) - \( 225 \) 

(D) - \( 175 \) 

###
Misconceptions:
(A) - Misunderstands the operation; assumes that subtracting a larger number will yield a smaller result correctly. 

(B) - Confuses the relationship between the numbers; assumes subtraction involves taking away from a larger number rather than finding a difference. 

(C) - Assumes they just need to subtract 200 from 475 directly without applying the correct operation. 

(D) - Recognizes the need to subtract but miscalculates, thinking the missing number is simply half of the difference.
