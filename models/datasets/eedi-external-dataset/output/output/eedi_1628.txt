Question: What are the approximate solutions to the equation \(2x^2 - 5x + 3 = 0\) based on the given graph? ![A set of axes showing the quadratic graph y=2x^2-5x+3 drawn on.]()

###
Answers:
(A) - \( x=\frac{3}{2}, \quad x=1 \)

(B) - \( y=0 \)

(C) - \( x=3, \quad x=\frac{1}{2} \)

(D) - \( x=2, \quad x=\frac{3}{4} \)

###
Misconceptions:
(A) - Reads the values incorrectly from the graph by not following the intersection points of the graph with the x-axis correctly 

(B) - Identifies the x-intercept as the y-value, failing to note that the solutions are where the graph intersects the x-axis 

(C) - Confuses the shape and position of the graph, resulting in incorrect values for the roots 

(D) - Misapplies the vertex formula instead of simply identifying the x-intercepts
