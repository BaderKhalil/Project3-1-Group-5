Question: If two angles around a point \( g \) and \( g+30 \) are given, what equation represents their relationship? ![Angles around a point made up of two angles labelled: g and g + 30]()

###
Answers:
(A) - \( g + (g + 30) = 360 \) 

(B) - \( g + (g + 30) = 180 \) 

(C) - \( g + (g + 30) = g \) 

(D) - \( 2g + 30 = 360 \) 

###
Misconceptions:
(A) - nan 

(B) - Thinks angles around a point sum to 180 

(C) - Misunderstands that angles cannot equal one of the angles directly 

(D) - Incorrect assumption that doubling the angle results in the equality with the total angle around a point
