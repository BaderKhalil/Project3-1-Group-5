Question: Step 1: Factorise the following expression
\(
3 x^{2}+10 x+3
\)

###
Answers:
(A) - \( (3 x+1)(x+3) \)

(B) - \( (3 x+3)(x+1) \)

(C) - \( (3 x+1)(3 x+1) \)

(D) - Cannot be factorised

###
Misconceptions:
(A) - Believes that all coefficients must be used as factors, resulting in an incorrect combination.

(B) - Thinks that both terms can share the same coefficient without ensuring the product matches the original expression.

(C) - Assumes that the factor must be a perfect square leading to the same term used twice.

(D) - Misunderstands the rules of factorisation, assuming that factorisation is impossible without checking further options.
