Question: Which of the following expressions demonstrates that Ethan's conjecture, which states that \( n^{3} + n^{2} \geq 0 \) for all integers \( n \), is not universally true?

###  
Answers:  
(A) - \( (-1)^{3} + (-1)^{2} \)  

(B) - \( (0)^{3} + (0)^{2} \)  

(C) - \( (-2)^{3} + (-2)^{2} \)  

(D) - \( (1)^{3} + (1)^{2} \)  

###  
Misconceptions:  
(A) - Believes that negative results cannot occur when adding negative numbers with positive results  

(B) - Understands that zero is a valid input, but miscalculates the outcome  

(C) - Thinks that using negative inputs will always yield a positive output  

(D) - Correctly interprets the situation and realizes this will be positive, confirming the conjecture
