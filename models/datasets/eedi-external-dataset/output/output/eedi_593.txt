Question: A rectangle is reflected over the line \( y = 2 \). What are the new coordinates of the point \( \mathrm{Q} \) located at \( (3, 1) \) after the reflection? 

###
Answers:
(A) - \( (3, 3) \)

(B) - \( (3, 5) \)

(C) - \( (3, 0) \)

(D) - \( (3, 2) \)

###
Misconceptions:
(A) - Correct answer, point is reflected correctly over the line \( y = 2 \) (no misconception).

(B) - Incorrect reflection resulting in the point being moved further away from the line of reflection instead of closer.

(C) - Reflects in the wrong direction, leading to a position below the original point rather than the reflected position above the line.

(D) - Misunderstands reflection by moving the point only a single unit without accounting for the actual distance needed to reflect across the line.
