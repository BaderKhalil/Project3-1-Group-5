Question: The area of this trapezoid is \( 50 \mathrm{~cm}^{2} \).

What is the length of \( b \) ? ![A trapezoid with the parallel sides labelled with 5cm and \( b \) and the height labelled with 10cm]()

###
Answers:
(A) - \( 10 \mathrm{~cm} \)

(B) - \( 7 \mathrm{~cm} \)

(C) - \( 5 \mathrm{~cm} \)

(D) - \( 15 \mathrm{~cm} \)

###
Misconceptions:
(A) - nan

(B) - Fails to apply the correct area formula for trapezoids, resulting in incorrect dimension.

(C) - Assumes both bases are equal without considering the area condition.

(D) - Overestimates the base length by miscalculating how area relates to dimensions.
