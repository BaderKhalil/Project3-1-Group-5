Question: Aisha and Mark are trying to find the coordinates that would define a rectangle. Aisha claims that the points \( (2,3) \) and \( (2,7) \) are correct, while Mark argues for the points \( (4,5) \) and \( (8,5) \). Who is correct? ![A pair of axes with no labels, 1st quadrant only. 2 points are marked with blue dots and are labelled with co-ordinates: (2, 3) and (2, 7).]() 

###
Answers:
(A) - Only Aisha 

(B) - Only Mark 

(C) - Both Aisha and Mark 

(D) - Neither is correct 

###
Misconceptions:
(A) - Thinks that a rectangle can only be aligned with the axes, missing the diagonal arrangement 

(B) - Believes a rectangle can only be formed with two horizontal points when they should also cover the height 

(C) - Incorrectly assumes both sets of coordinates can create valid rectangles regardless of distances 

(D) - Does not understand how to determine the necessary conditions for rectangle formation from given coordinates
