Question: In a bag, there are \( 5 \) blue marbles and \( 3 \) green marbles. After drawing one blue marble, it is not put back into the bag. What is the probability of drawing a green marble next? 

###
Answers:
(A) - \( \frac{3}{8} \) 

(B) - \( \frac{2}{7} \) 

(C) - \( \frac{3}{7} \) 

(D) - \( \frac{5}{8} \) 

###
Misconceptions:
(A) - Assumes the total number of marbles remains the same after one is drawn. 

(B) - Incorrectly calculates the remaining marbles without considering that one blue marble was removed. 

(C) - Correctly reduces the numerator but fails to account for the actual total number of marbles left. 

(D) - Assumes that there are still \( 8 \) marbles in total after one draw.
