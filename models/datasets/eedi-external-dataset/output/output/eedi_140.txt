Question: Factorise this expression, if possible:
\(
x^{2} - 64
\)

###
Answers:
(A) - \( (x+8)(x-8) \)

(B) - \( (x-8)^2 \)

(C) - \( x(x-64) \)

(D) - Does not factorise

###
Misconceptions:
(A) - Correctly identifies it as a difference of squares but incorrectly applies the formula.

(B) - Treats it as a perfect square trinomial rather than recognizing the difference of squares.

(C) - Attempts to factor out an incorrect common factor.

(D) - Believes the expression is irreducible without checking the possibility of factorisation.
