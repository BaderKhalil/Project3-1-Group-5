Question: Sarah and Alex are discussing corresponding angles.
Sarah claims angles \( a \) and \( b \) are corresponding.
Alex argues angles \( a \) and \( b \) are not corresponding angles but rather alternate angles. Who is correct? ![Shows two parallel lines intersected by a transversal. Angles A and B are positioned in corresponding positions relative to the parallel lines.]() 

###
Answers:
(A) - Only
Sarah 

(B) - Only
Alex 

(C) - Both Sarah and Alex 

(D) - Neither is correct 

###
Misconceptions:
(A) - Thinks corresponding angles are only equal if lines are cut by a transversal 

(B) - Thinks alternate angles can never be found in corresponding positions 

(C) - Thinks both types of angles can represent the same physical angles in different situations 

(D) - Thinks angles cannot correspond if they are on different sides of the transversal
