Question: Sarah and Mark are talking about parallel lines.
Sarah claims that \( y=4x+2 \) and \( y=4x-3 \) are parallel.
Mark states that \( y=4x+2 \) and \( y=-4x+2 \) are parallel.
Who is accurate?

###
Answers:
(A) - Only Sarah 

(B) - Only Mark 

(C) - Both Sarah and Mark 

(D) - Neither is correct 

###
Misconceptions:
(A) - Believes lines are parallel simply because they have the same slope, regardless of y-intercepts. 

(B) - Thinks that lines can be parallel even if they have different slopes, as long as their y-intercepts are the same. 

(C) - Incorrectly believes that both pairs of lines can be parallel by having the same or negative slopes. 

(D) - Misunderstands the properties of parallel lines and concludes that none are parallel.
