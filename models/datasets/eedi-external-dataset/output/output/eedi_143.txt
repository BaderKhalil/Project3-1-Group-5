Question: When completing the square for the equation \( x^{2} + 8x + 15 \), what value should replace the star? \( (x + \bigstar)^{2} - k \) 

###
Answers:
(A) - \( \bigstar = 4 \) 

(B) - \( \bigstar = 8 \) 

(C) - \( \bigstar = 2 \) 

(D) - \( \bigstar = -4 \) 

###
Misconceptions:
(A) - Thinks the value in the parentheses is derived from dividing the x-term coefficient by 2. 

(B) - Misinterprets the constant term instead of focusing on the coefficient of the x-term. 

(C) - Misunderstands how to derive the linear coefficient from the original equation and fails to complete it correctly.

(D) - Believes the value inside the parentheses should be negative, confusing the signs during the process.
