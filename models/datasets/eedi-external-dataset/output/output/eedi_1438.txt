Question: What is the formula for finding the nth term of the following linear sequence?

\[
5, 10, 15, 20, 25, \ldots
\]

###
Answers:
(A) - The formula is \( n + 5 \)

(B) - The formula is \( 5n - 5 \)

(C) - The formula is \( 5n \)

(D) - The formula is \( 10n \)

###
Misconceptions:
(A) - Misunderstands how to formulate an arithmetic sequence and does not account for the factor of multiplication needed.

(B) - Incorrectly subtracts 5 from the entire sequence which does not align with how to determine the nth term.

(C) - Correctly identifies the format and starting point of the sequence, but misses identifying the correct relationship in the increment.

(D) - Incorrectly identifies the growth factor of the sequence and assumes a multiplier higher than the actual common difference.
