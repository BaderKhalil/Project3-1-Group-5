Question: What could go in the missing gaps? \begin{tabular}{|l|l|l|l|}
\hline \multicolumn{4}{|c|}{\( 12x + 5 \)} \\
\hline \( 8x \) & \( -3 \) & \( ? \) & \( ? \) \\
\hline
\end{tabular} 

###
Answers:
(A) - \( 4x \) and \( 8 \) 

(B) - \( 4x + 8 \) 

(C) - \( 5x \) and \( 12 \) 

(D) - \( 6x \) and \( 6 - x \) 

###
Misconceptions:
(A) - When calculating the values for gaps, overlooks combining similar terms leading to a wrong interpretation of the sum. 

(B) - Assumes the expression is already simplified correctly without checking for proper collection of like terms.

(C) - Misunderstands the combination of terms, adding an extra variable term instead of maintaining equivalence. 

(D) - Incorrectly applies a method of distribution instead of focusing on the need to combine like terms properly.
