Question: Amina jogs faster at the beginning, maintains her speed for a while, and then walks slowly to cool down. Which of the following velocity \( (v) \) time \( (t) \) graphs best represents Amina's activity?

###
Answers:
(A) - ![A graph with time on the horizontal axis and velocity on the vertical axis. The graph starts above the origin, travels horizontally right, then gradually decreases at a shallow slope until reaching the horizontal axis.]() 

(B) - ![A graph with time on the horizontal axis and velocity on the vertical axis. The graph starts at the origin, climbs steeply to a peak, remains horizontal, and then slopes down gently until it reaches the horizontal axis.]() 

(C) - ![A graph with time on the horizontal axis and velocity on the vertical axis. The graph starts at the origin, increases steeply, remains constant, and then increases again at a steeper slope.]() 

(D) - ![A graph with time on the horizontal axis and velocity on the vertical axis. The graph starts at the origin, climbs steeply, then rapidly decreases to a negative value, indicating reverse motion.]() 

###
Misconceptions:
(A) - Incorrectly assumes that maintaining a speed means a horizontal line with a gradual decrease should represent slow motion instead of a complete stop. 

(B) - nan 

(C) - Misunderstands that after maintaining a speed, the graph should show a decrease, not an increase.

(D) - Believes that a negative slope in a graph indicates a continuation of motion rather than coming to rest.
