Question: For the quadratic equation \(2x^2 - 4x - 6 = 0\), what are the approximate solutions based on the graph? ![A set of axes with the quadratic graph y=2x^2-4x-6 drawn on.]() 

###
Answers:
(A) - \( x=-3 \) 

(B) - \( x=4 \quad x=-0.5 \) 

(C) - \( x=3 \quad x=-1 \) 

(D) - \( x=1.5 \quad x=-2 \) 

###
Misconceptions:
(A) - Misinterprets the graph by focusing on a previous intersection point instead of current solutions. 

(B) - Incorrectly uses the vertex or maximum point instead of the x-intercepts to determine roots. 

(C) - Incorrectly identifies the roots of the equation based on visual estimation from the graph. 

(D) - Approaches the problem as if it has only one solution rather than considering multiple x-intercepts.
