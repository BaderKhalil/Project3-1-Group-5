Question: Solve the following pair of simultaneous equations: \( \begin{array}{l}2x + 3y = 12 \\ 5x - y = 1\end{array} \)

###
Answers:
(A) - \( \begin{array}{l}x=3 \\ y=2\end{array} \)

(B) - \( \begin{array}{l}x=2 \\ y=3\end{array} \)

(C) - \( \begin{array}{l}x=1 \\ y=3.33\end{array} \)

(D) - \( \begin{array}{l}x=4 \\ y=0\end{array} \)

###
Misconceptions:
(A) - The solution is miscalculated due to incorrect substitution or addition.

(B) - Incorrectly assumed the values of \(x\) and \(y\) satisfy both equations when they do not.

(C) - Made errors in calculation leading to non-integer and incorrect values.

(D) - Misconstrues the second equation and overlooks the need for both conditions to be satisfied simultaneously.
