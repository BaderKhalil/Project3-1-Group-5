Question: Which of the following equations is not parallel to
\[
y=3x-5 \text{ ? }
\]

###
Answers:
(A) - \( 9y=27x-45 \)

(B) - \( y=3(2-x) \)

(C) - \( y=\frac{1}{3}x+2 \)

(D) - \( y=3x+10 \)

###
Misconceptions:
(A) - Believes that scaling the equation of a line does not change its slope, even though it does not change its parallelism with other lines.

(B) - Misinterprets that the coefficient of x indicates the slope, but does not realize the expression is actually in a form that reveals the negative effect on the gradient.

(C) - Cannot identify that a fraction (1/3) indicates a different slope compared to the original line (3) and incorrectly assumes it parallel.

(D) - Correctly identifies the slope as 3 but fails to recognize that it leads to a different y-intercept, thus making the lines parallel.
