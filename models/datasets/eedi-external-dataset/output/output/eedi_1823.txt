Question: ![An image of several parallel lines and a transversal on a coordinate plane. The transversal forms angles with the parallels. Lines PQ and RS are parallel horizontal lines, AB and CD are vertical lines, and EF is a diagonal line cutting through them at various angles.]() Which angle is corresponding to angle \( \mathrm{EF} \)? 

###
Answers:
(A) - Angle \( \mathrm{AB} \) 

(B) - Angle \( \mathrm{PQ} \) 

(C) - Angle \( \mathrm{RS} \) 

(D) - Angle \( \mathrm{CD} \) 

###
Misconceptions:
(A) - Confuses corresponding angles with alternate interior angles 

(B) - Does not recognize that horizontal lines cannot correspond to angles formed by a transversal 

(C) - Believes that parallel lines create angles with their direct intersections which are not corresponding 

(D) - Correctly identifies the angle but misplaces the relation to transversal intersections
