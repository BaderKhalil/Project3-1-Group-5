Question: Alex and Jamie are analyzing the slopes of two lines.
Alex states that \( y = 5 + 2x \) and \( y = 3 + 2x \) are parallel.
Jamie claims that \( y = 5 + 2x \) and \( y = 5 - 2x \) are parallel.
Who is correct?

###
Answers:
(A) - Only Alex

(B) - Only Jamie

(C) - Both Alex and Jamie

(D) - Neither is correct

###
Misconceptions:
(A) - Believes that lines are parallel as long as they have the same slope, regardless of the y-intercept.

(B) - Thinks that lines can be parallel if they have the same y-intercept, neglecting the importance of the slope.

(C) - Assumes that having either the same slope or y-intercept is sufficient for parallelism.

(D) - nan
