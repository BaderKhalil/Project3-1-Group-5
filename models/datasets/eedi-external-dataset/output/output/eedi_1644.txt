Question: A rectangle has a length of \( 20 \) cm and a width marked as \( w \) cm. If the ratio of the length to the width is \( 4: w \), what is the value of \( w \)? ![A rectangle with a length marked '20cm' and width marked 'w'. A ratio line goes from length to width, denoting '4:w'.]()

###
Answers:
(A) - \( 5 \) cm 

(B) - \( 10 \) cm 

(C) - \( 8 \) cm 

(D) - \( 4 \) cm 

###
Misconceptions:
(A) - Misunderstands the ratio and incorrectly calculates the width based on the length being smaller. 

(B) - Miscalculates the ratio and assumes the width should be half of the length due to misunderstanding proportional relationships in ratios. 

(C) - Incorrectly translates the ratio leading to a wrong computation and believes the width is a fixed fraction of the length. 

(D) - Assumes a direct comparison without proportion, thinking \( w \) can be the same as another unrelated measurement.
