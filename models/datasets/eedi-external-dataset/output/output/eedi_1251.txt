Question: Simplify the following expression by collecting like terms.
\[
5y + 2y - 4y
\]

###
Answers:
(A) - \(3y\)

(B) - \(7y - 4y\)

(C) - \(4y\)

(D) - \(y\)

###
Misconceptions:
(A) - Treats the first two terms as non-related, not combining them correctly.

(B) - Keeps one term intact while misapplying subtraction for the other terms, showing a misunderstanding of simplification rules.

(C) - Misapplies the rule of combining coefficients, leading to an incorrect total.

(D) - Incorrectly assumes that subtracting yields a constant instead of a variable, misunderstanding the concept completely.
