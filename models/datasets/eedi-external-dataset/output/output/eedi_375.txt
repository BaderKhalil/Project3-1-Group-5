Question: If \( D E = 2 D F \), what are the coordinates of \( F \) given that points D and E are on the line defined by \( y = -\frac{1}{2}x + 5 \) and D is at (4, 3) and E is at (0, 5) ? ![A straight line with the equation y = -1/2 x + 5 is illustrated with points D and E plotted on it.]() 

###
Answers:
(A) - \( (2, 4) \) 

(B) - \( (6, 0) \)

(C) - \( (8, -1) \)

(D) - \( (10, -2) \) 

###
Misconceptions:
(A) - Incorrectly evaluates the distance proportionality, miscalculating the actual length of segments. 

(B) - Misunderstands how to use the midpoint formula when working with coordinate ratios.

(C) - Assumes the segments are equal rather than applying the correct ratio.

(D) - Fails to recognize the correct placement of points on a negative slope line.
