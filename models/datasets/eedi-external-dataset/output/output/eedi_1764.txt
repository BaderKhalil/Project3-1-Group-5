Question: Sarah is analyzing the function machine! ![A function machine with an input of 2b, the function is not labeled and then an output of 6b + 8]() Sarah thinks the function could be \( \times 3 \), while Mike believes the function could be \( +4b \). Whose interpretation do you find correct?

###
Answers:
(A) - Only Sarah

(B) - Only Mike

(C) - Both Sarah and Mike

(D) - Neither is correct

###
Misconceptions:
(A) - Incorrectly assumes that multiplying the input by 3 gives the output directly.

(B) - Incorrectly assumes that just adding 4b to the input results in the output.

(C) - Misunderstands that functions can only operate by addition or multiplication separately.

(D) - Misjudges that both interpretations are entirely incorrect despite being partially valid.
