Question: Consider the function machine. ![An image of a function machine where the first operation is multiply by 2, and then the second operation adds 6. The output is 20. The second function machine shows that the input is 20, but both operations are blank.]() What are the correct operations to find the input of this function machine?
\(2x + 6 = 20\)

###
Answers:
(A) - \( \begin{array}{l}\div 2 \\ -6\end{array} \) 

(B) - \( \begin{array}{l} -6 \\ \div 2\end{array} \) 

(C) - \( \begin{array}{r} +6 \\ \div 2\end{array} \)

(D) - \( \begin{array}{l}-6 \\ \times 2\end{array} \) 

###
Misconceptions:
(A) - Does not reverse the correct order of operations when trying to isolate the variable

(B) - Does not apply the correct operations for reversing the operations that affect the input value

(C) - Incorrectly suggests adding 6 before dividing, which does not isolate the variable correctly

(D) - Incorrectly multiplies instead of correctly dividing to isolate the variable from operations applied
