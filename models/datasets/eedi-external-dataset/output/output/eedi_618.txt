Question: What is \( \frac{7}{25} \) expressed as a percentage?

###
Answers:
(A) - \( 28\% \)

(B) - \( 30\% \)

(C) - \( 25\% \)

(D) - \( 35\% \)

###
Misconceptions:
(A) - Believes that to convert to a percentage you simply divide the numerator by the denominator and multiply by 100 accurately.

(B) - Miscalculates by thinking \( 30 \% \) is obtained by rounding the fraction to the nearest whole number incorrectly.

(C) - Incorrectly assumes \( 25\% \) is the value because they see the denominator as a common conversion point (1/4).

(D) - Misunderstands that they are multiplying the fraction out of 25 instead of consistently converting to a percentage out of 100.
