Question: ![An image of 5 boxes, each box representing a number in a sequence. The first box contains the number 300, the second box is empty, the third contains the number 234 and the fourth and fifth boxes are also empty.]() A descending linear sequence has a constant difference of \( 22 \) and the \( 3^{\text{rd}} \) term is \( 234 \). What should replace the empty box in the second position?

###
Answers:
(A) - \( 256 \)

(B) - \( 212 \)

(C) - \( 278 \)

(D) - \( 272 \)

###
Misconceptions:
(A) - Thinks you add rather than subtract when finding the previous term in a descending linear sequence.

(B) - Thinks the difference is larger than it actually is, resulting in a further value down the sequence.

(C) - Thinks the constant difference applies to the next term instead of the previous term.

(D) - nan
