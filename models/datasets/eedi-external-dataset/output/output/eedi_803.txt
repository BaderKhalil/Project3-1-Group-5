Question: A square has vertices at points \( A(1, 1) \), \( B(1, 4) \), \( C(4, 4) \), and \( D(4, 1) \). If the square is translated 3 units to the right, what are the new coordinates of point \( B \)?

###
Answers:
(A) - \( (1, 4) \) 

(B) - \( (4, 4) \) 

(C) - \( (4, 4) \) 

(D) - \( (4, 1) \) 

###
Misconceptions:
(A) - Fails to apply translation correctly

(B) - Correct translation but confuses the identity of the point

(C) - Correct translation but repeats another answer

(D) - Fails to identify the correct point after translation
