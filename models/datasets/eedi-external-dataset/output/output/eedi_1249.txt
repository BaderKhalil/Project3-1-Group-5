Question: For the quadratic equation 
\(
x^{2} - 5x + 6 \equiv (x + p)(x + q)
\)
determine the value of \( p \times q = \)

###
Answers:
(A) - \( -6 \)

(B) - \( 6 \)

(C) - \( -5 \)

(D) - \( 5 \)

###
Misconceptions:
(A) - Incorrectly assumes that the product of the constants in the brackets corresponds directly with the product of the linear coefficient from the expanded equation. 

(B) - Believes the constant term in the expanded quadratic is always positive regardless of the signs of the binomials.

(C) - Misunderstands that the sum of the roots comes from the linear coefficient, rather than the product of the constants.

(D) - Incorrectly thinks the product of the constants must always be positive in quadratic factorizations regardless of the signs of the terms.
