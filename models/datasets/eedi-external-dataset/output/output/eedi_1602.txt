Question: Sarah and Paul are debating how to factorise the expression

Sarah claims \( x^{2} - 5x + 6 \equiv (x - 3)(x - 2) \)

Paul claims \( x^{2} - 5x + 6 \equiv x(x - 5 + 6) \)

Who is correct?

###
Answers:
(A) - Only Sarah 

(B) - Only Paul 

(C) - Both Sarah and Paul 

(D) - Neither is correct 

###
Misconceptions:
(A) - Correctly factors the quadratic expression but misunderstands the roots. 

(B) - Attempts to factor a quadratic without recognizing the structure and mistakenly applies the linear factor approach incorrectly.

(C) - Incorrectly assumes both expressions can represent the same quadratic.

(D) - Believes neither person understands factorisation rules, despite one being correct.
