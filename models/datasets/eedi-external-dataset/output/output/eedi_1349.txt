Question: Maria has two equations involving \( x \) and \( y \):
\(\begin{array}{l}
4 x + 5 y = 20 \\
2 x + 3 y = 10
\end{array}\)

She wants to eliminate \( x \) from these equations. What is a correct transformation of both equations to achieve that?

###
Answers:
(A) - \( \begin{array}{l}8 x + 10 y = 40 \\ 8 x + 12 y = 40\end{array} \) 

(B) - \( \begin{array}{l}8 x + 10 y = 20 \\ 8 x + 6 y = 20\end{array} \) 

(C) - \( \begin{array}{l}4 x + 10 y = 20 \\ 2 x + 6 y = 10\end{array} \) 

(D) - \( \begin{array}{l}8 x + 10 y = 40 \\ 4 x + 6 y = 20\end{array} \) 

###
Misconceptions:
(A) - When scaling an equation, the student thinks they can adjust any coefficient without maintaining the proportionality of the equations.

(B) - The student misinterprets how to scale the equations and believes the constant on the right side does not need attention or adjustment when multiplying through.

(C) - The student underestimates the need to scale both equations consistently to eliminate the variable properly.

(D) - nan
