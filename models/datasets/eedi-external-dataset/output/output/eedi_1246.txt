Question: What is the equation of this line? ![A set of axes with a line drawn on. The line passes through the points: (1,3) (2,3) (3,3) (4,3) and (5,3)]() 

###
Answers:
(A) - \( x=3 \) 

(B) - \( y=3x \) 

(C) - \( y=3 \) 

(D) - \( y=3x + 1 \) 

###
Misconceptions:
(A) - Thinks x = ? is a horizontal line that passes through ? 

(B) - Believes that the equation of a horizontal line can be written in the format \( y=ax \) where a is the slope 

(C) - Correctly identifies the y-coordinate of the horizontal line but misunderstands that the equation format is constant for y 

(D) - Misunderstands the relationship between y and x, thinking that the line has a slope
