Question: ![A coordinate grid with a triangle marked ABC with points A(1,1), B(5,1), and C(3,4)]() What can you infer about the sides of triangle \( \mathrm{ABC} \) based on its vertices?

###
Answers:
(A) - Side \( \mathrm{AB} \) is longer than side \( \mathrm{AC} \)

(B) - Side \( \mathrm{AB} \) is shorter than side \( \mathrm{AC} \)

(C) - All sides of triangle \( \mathrm{ABC} \) are equal in length

(D) - We can't determine the relative lengths without calculating them explicitly

###
Misconceptions:
(A) - Assumes the horizontal base length is greater than an inclined length based only on endpoints without calculating

(B) - Misunderstands that diagonal sides can often appear shorter based on vertical alignment without comparing the actual lengths

(C) - Incorrectly assumes equilateral properties based on visual inspection alone rather than calculating side lengths

(D) - Fails to recognize that coordinate differences can provide information about lengths without direct measurement
