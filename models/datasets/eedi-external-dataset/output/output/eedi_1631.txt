Question: Sarah and Jake are examining a graph that tracks the temperature (T) of a cup of coffee over time (t). Sarah claims that the graph shows a temperature decrease at a constant rate ![A sketch of a graph with T on the y axis and t on the x axis. A line starts high on the y axis and slopes downwards straight across the graph. ]() Jake argues that the graph shows the temperature decreasing faster initially and then slowing down over time ![A sketch of a graph with T on the y axis and t on the x axis. A line that steeply declines at first and then levels off.]() Who is correct?

###
Answers:
(A) - Only Sarah 

(B) - Only Jake 

(C) - Both Sarah and Jake 

(D) - Neither is correct 

###
Misconceptions:
(A) - Believes a straight line represents a variable rate of change

(B) - Believes a decreasing slope cannot represent a constant initial rapid decrease

(C) - Misunderstands the distinct behaviors of lines on graphs 

(D) - Believes that temperature cannot change in a predictable manner
