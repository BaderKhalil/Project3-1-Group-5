Question: Sarah and Mike are evaluating the following system of equations: Sarah asserts that to eliminate \( x \), they should subtract the equations given by 
\(\begin{array}{r}
2x + y = 10 \\
3x - y = 5
\end{array}\). Mike argues that they should add the equations to eliminate \( x \) instead. Who is correct? 

###
Answers:
(A) - Only Sarah 

(B) - Only Mike 

(C) - Both Sarah and Mike 

(D) - Neither is correct 

###
Misconceptions:
(A) - Does not understand that subtracting the equations correctly does not lead to eliminating \( x \) in this case. 

(B) - Misunderstands that adding the equations directly leads to the elimination of \( x \) when it does not. 

(C) - Fails to recognize that one of the methods is incorrect. 

(D) - Believes that no method can successfully eliminate \( x \).
