Question: Sarah is trying to solve the equation:
\(
5(n + 3) = 40
\)
She thinks she can simplify it to: \( 5n + 3 = 40 \) or perhaps \( n + 3 = 8 \). Which of Sarah's thought processes is correct?

###
Answers:
(A) - Only the first simplification is correct

(B) - Only the second simplification is correct

(C) - Both simplifications are correct

(D) - Neither simplification is correct

###
Misconceptions:
(A) - Thinks that the constant (3) can be separated without proper distribution when expanding brackets

(B) - Does not apply the correct arithmetic operation to simplify \(5(n + 3)\)

(C) - Incorrectly assumes both simplifications are valid without checking the distribution of 5

(D) - Does not understand the principles of distribution in equations
