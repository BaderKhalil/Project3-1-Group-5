Question: A rectangle is reflected over the line \( y = -x \). What are the new coordinates of point \( Q \) after the reflection, if \( Q \) has the coordinates (1, -2)? ![A coordinate grid with a rectangle and the reflection line drawn. The rectangle's corners are at (1, -2), (4, -2), (1, 1), and (4, 1). Q is the coordinate (1, -2).]()

###
Answers:
(A) - \( (-2, -1) \) 

(B) - \( (-2, 4) \) 

(C) - \( (2, 1) \) 

(D) - \( (1, -1) \) 

###
Misconceptions:
(A) - Incorrectly applies the reflection formula. 

(B) - Fails to understand how the coordinates change sign when reflecting over \( y = -x \). 

(C) - Fails to reflect across mirror line by incorrectly switching x and y values without negating them.

(D) - Fails to account for the diagonal nature of the reflection and does not reverse the signs.
