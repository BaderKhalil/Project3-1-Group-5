Question: What is the size of angle \( x \) given that it forms a linear pair with an angle measuring \( 110^{\circ} \)? ![Angles forming a linear pair where one angle is labeled 110 degrees and the other is \( x \)]() 

###
Answers:
(A) - \( 70^{\circ} \) 

(B) - \( 110^{\circ} \) 

(C) - \( 80^{\circ} \) 

(D) - \( 120^{\circ} \) 

###
Misconceptions:
(A) - Thinks that the angles are complementary and should sum to 90 

(B) - Misunderstands that linear pairs are supplementary and calculates incorrectly 

(C) - Incorrectly applies the rule of complementary angles instead of supplementary 

(D) - Believes that angles can exceed 180 degrees in a linear pair
