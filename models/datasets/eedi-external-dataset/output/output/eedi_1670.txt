Question: Jessica needs to find the volume of a triangular prism with a triangular base that has a height of 5 cm and a base length of 4 cm. To do this, which length does she need to find the area of first?

Which area should she calculate? ![The diagram shows a right-angled triangular prism with arrows pointing to the triangular base and two rectangular faces.]()

Answers:
(A) - ![A points to 'the rectangular face' which is the side face of the prism]() 

(B) - ![B points to 'the base' which is the triangular face that forms the bottom of the prism]() 

(C) - ![C points to 'the front' which is the rectangular face adjacent to the triangular base]() 

(D) - ![D points to 'the back' which is another rectangular face opposite to the front face]()

Misconceptions:
(A) - Thinks any face can be used to find the volume of a prism, not realizing the importance of the base area. 

(B) - nan 

(C) - Thinks the volume can be calculated using the area of a rectangular face instead of the triangular base. 

(D) - Thinks any rectangular face will suffice for volume calculation, confusing the base area requirement.
