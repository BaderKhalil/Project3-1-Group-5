Question: Which of the following diagrams represents \( x > 0 \) and \( x \leq 3 \) ? 

###
Answers:
(A) - ![Number line from -1 to 4. Open circle at 0 with arrow to the right. Closed circle at 3 with arrow to the left. ]() 

(B) - ![Number line from -1 to 4. Closed circle at 0 with arrow to the right. Closed circle at 3 with arrow to the left. ]() 

(C) - ![Number line from -1 to 4. Open circle at 0 with arrow to the right. Open circle at 3 with arrow to the left. ]() 

(D) - ![Number line from -1 to 4. Closed circle at 0 with arrow to the right. Open circle at 3 with arrow to the left. ]() 

###
Misconceptions:
(A) - Correctly represents the boundary conditions, as it includes values greater than zero up to and including 3. 

(B) - Misunderstands that \( x > 0 \) requires an open circle at 0 since 0 is not included. 

(C) - Incorrectly implies that 3 is not included because it is also an open circle, which contradicts the condition \( x \leq 3 \).

(D) - Confuses the meanings of the filled and unfilled circles, indicating that 3 is not included while 0 should be open.
