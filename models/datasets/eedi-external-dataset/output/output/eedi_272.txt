Question: What transformation maps the graph of \(y=f(x)\) to the graph of \(y=f(-x)\) 

###
Answers:
(A) - Reflection in the \(y\)-axis 

(B) - Reflection in the \(x\)-axis 

(C) - Vertical stretch 

(D) - Horizontal stretch 

###
Misconceptions:
(A) - nan 

(B) - Believes f(-x) indicates a reflection in the x-axis 

(C) - Confuses the effect of stretching with reflection 

(D) - Misunderstands that f(-x) corresponds to horizontal transformations 

###
Subject: Transformations of functions in the form f(x)
