Question: According to the graph, what is the approximate solution to
\(2x^{2}-8x+6=0\) ![A set of axes with the quadratic graph y=2x^2-8x+6 drawn on.](https://example.com) 

###
Answers:
(A) - \( x=3, \quad x=1 \)

(B) - \( x=4, \quad x=1 \)

(C) - No real solutions 

(D) - \( x=2 \)

###
Misconceptions:
(A) - Incorrectly solves for the x-intercepts instead of factoring or using the quadratic formula correctly. 

(B) - Finds a solution from a point on the graph instead of determining the x-intercepts.

(C) - Misunderstands the discriminant, concluding that there are no intersections when the graph does intersect the x-axis.

(D) - Identifies the vertex or the minimum point instead of the x-intercepts.
