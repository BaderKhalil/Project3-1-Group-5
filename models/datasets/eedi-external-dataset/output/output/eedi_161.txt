Question: If this sequence continues, how many triangles do you anticipate will appear in the \( 5 \) th term of this sequence? ![A diagram showing the first 3 patterns in a sequence. Pattern 1 has 3 triangles. Pattern 2 has 5 triangles. Pattern 3 has 7 triangles.]() 

###
Answers:
(A) - \( 9 \) 

(B) - \( 7 \) 

(C) - \( 11 \) 

(D) - \( 5 \) 

###
Misconceptions:
(A) - Has added \( 2 \) for each subsequent term without understanding the pattern 

(B) - When asked for a specific term in a sequence uses the value from the previous term 

(C) - When calculating for a specific term misinterprets the pattern and adds more than necessary 

(D) - nan
