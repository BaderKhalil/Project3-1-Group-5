Question: Find the measure of angle \( y \) in the right triangle. ![\( A \)]() 

###
Answers:
(A) - \( 34^{\circ} \) 

(B) - \( 56^{\circ} \) 

(C) - \( 90^{\circ} \) 

(D) - \( 46^{\circ} \) 

###
Misconceptions:
(A) - Underestimates the sum of angles in a triangle and calculates based on one angle alone.

(B) - Incorrectly assumes that the angle \( y \) must be complementary to the given angle but doesn't account for the right angle.

(C) - Misunderstands that a right triangle cannot have an angle equal to 90Â° other than the right angle itself.

(D) - Confuses the definition of acute angles believing any angle can fit without checking the existing angles in the triangle.
