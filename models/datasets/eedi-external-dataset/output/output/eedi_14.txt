Question: \(
x_{n+1} = 3 + \frac{1}{x_{n}}
\)

Using a starting value of \( x_{1} = 1 \), what is the solution to \( x = 3 + \frac{1}{x} \) to \( 2 \) decimal places? 

###
Answers:
(A) - \( 3.25 \) 

(B) - \( 3.3333 \ldots \) 

(C) - \( 3.33 \) 

(D) - \( 3.34 \) 

###
Misconceptions:
(A) - Underestimates the value because of incorrect iterations 

(B) - Uses an infinite decimal without rounding appropriately 

(C) - Rounds to the wrong degree of accuracy (significant figures rather than decimal places) 

(D) - nan
