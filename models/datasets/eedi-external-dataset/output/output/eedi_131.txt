Question: Solve the equation:
\(
x + 3 = \frac{1}{4}
\)

###
Answers:
(A) - \( x = \frac{1}{4} - 3 \)

(B) - \( x = \frac{1}{4} + 3 \)

(C) - \( x = \frac{1}{4} - \frac{12}{4} \)

(D) - \( x = -\frac{11}{4} \)

###
Misconceptions:
(A) - Miscalculates by thinking that just subtracting leads directly to the answer without converting or simplifying.

(B) - Incorrectly applies addition instead of subtraction when solving for \(x\).

(C) - Correctly identifies the application of subtraction but struggles with negative fractions and simplification.

(D) - Correct answer that remains true to the original equation but may confuse the process of simplifying with converting.
