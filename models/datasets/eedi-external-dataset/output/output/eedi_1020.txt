Question: Triangle \( \mathrm{R} \) has been reduced by a scale factor of \( 0.75 \) to give triangle \( \mathrm{S} \).

What length should replace the star? ![Two triangles, the larger labelled R and the smaller labelled S. S has a base of 6cm and height of 9cm. The height of R is marked with a star.]()

###
Answers:
(A) - \( 12 \mathrm{~cm} \)

(B) - \( 8 \mathrm{~cm} \)

(C) - \( 7.5 \mathrm{~cm} \)

(D) - \( 9 \mathrm{~cm} \)

###
Misconceptions:
(A) - Incorrectly applies the scale factor by mixing up multiplication instead of division 

(B) - Not recognizing the correct relationship of dimensions in similar triangles 

(C) - Correct identification of corresponding dimensions but incorrect calculation with the scale factor 

(D) - Fails to recognize that the height of the larger triangle would be more than that of the smaller triangle
