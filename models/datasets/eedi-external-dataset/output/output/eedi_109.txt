### 
Question: Sarah and Mike are analyzing the properties of linear equations.

Sarah claims that all linear equations cross the \( y \) axis. Mike argues that a linear equation that does not cross the \( y \) axis must be horizontal.

Who is correct? 

### 
Answers:
(A) - Only Sarah 

(B) - Only Mike 

(C) - Both Sarah and Mike 

(D) - Neither is correct 

### 
Misconceptions:
(A) - They think that linear equations must have an intercept with the \( y \) axis, not understanding that vertical lines (undefined slope) do not conform to this rule.

(B) - They confuse horizontal lines with vertical lines, thinking if an equation doesn't cross the \( y \) axis, it must be horizontal.

(C) - They are mistakenly combining correct statements about different types of linear equations.

(D) - nan
