Answers:
(A) - \( 2 \)

(B) - Miscalculates the relationship of digits especially when dealing with higher numbers that require carrying.

(C) - Assumes that any number directly correlates with the addition presented without considering the operation properly.

(D) - Believes that the digits add directly without carrying into the next column, leading to an incorrect understanding of summation in positional notation.
