Question: What vector describes the translation that moves point A at (2, 5) to point B at (5, 8)? 

###
Answers:
(A) - \( \left(\begin{array}{c}3 \\ 3\end{array}\right) \) 

(B) - \( \left(\begin{array}{c}-3 \\ -3\end{array}\right) \) 

(C) - \( \left(\begin{array}{c}1 \\ 1\end{array}\right) \) 

(D) - \( \left(\begin{array}{c}2 \\ 2\end{array}\right) \) 

###
Misconceptions:
(A) - nan 

(B) - Misunderstands directionality and believes that the translation vector is reverse of the actual movement 

(C) - Fails to account for the correct distances moved in both dimensions 

(D) - Incorrectly concludes the change in coordinates without calculating the differences accurately
