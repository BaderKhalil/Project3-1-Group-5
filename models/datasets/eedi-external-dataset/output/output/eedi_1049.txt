###
Answers:
(A) - \( 4 \) 

(B) - \( 5 \) 

(C) - \( 6 \)

Misconceptions:
(A) - Thinks that the expression will have one less term than the number of binomials. 

(B) - nan 

(C) - Believes that expanding all products leads to distinct terms, overlooking possible like terms. 

(D) - Underestimates the total number of terms generated by three binomials.
