Question: Sarah and Mike are discussing how to accurately describe the transformation from triangle \( A \) to triangle \( B \).

Sarah says: "It's a rotation of \( 180^{\degree} \) around point \( (2,2) \)."

Mike says: "It's a rotation of \( 180^{\degree} \) counterclockwise."

Who is correct? ![A coordinate grid with two triangles drawn on it labelled A and B. Triangle A has the coordinates: (0,0), (0,2), (2,0), and Triangle B has the coordinates: (4,4), (4,6), (6,4).]()

###
Answers:
(A) - Only Sarah 

(B) - Only Mike 

(C) - Both Sarah and Mike 

(D) - Neither is correct 

###
Misconceptions:
(A) - Believes that the direction does not matter when specifying a rotation. 

(B) - Forgets to mention the center of rotation precisely. 

(C) - Thinks the center of rotation can be implied and does not need to be explicitly stated. 

(D) - nan
