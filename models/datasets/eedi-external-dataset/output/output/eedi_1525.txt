Question: What factor will appear in the box below when \( x^{2} + 5x + 6 \) is factorised? ![\( (x+2) \)]()

###
Answers:
(A) - \( (x+3) \)

(B) - \( (x-6) \)

(C) - \( (x+1) \)

(D) - \( (x-2) \)

###
Misconceptions:
(A) - Believes adding the two numbers in the factors gives the middle term coefficient, mixed up with constant terms.
(B) - Confuses the factor signs and believes the constant term comes from subtracting the two numbers in the brackets.
(C) - Misunderstands that one of the numbers must be larger than the other for positive factor pairs.
(D) - Believes the factors only consist of negative numbers when the original quadratic is positive.
