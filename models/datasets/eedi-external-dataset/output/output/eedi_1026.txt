Question: Maria and Tom are discussing which value can fill the blank in this equation: \( 3x + 5 = ? + 7 \). Maria believes it could be \( 2x - 2 \) while Tom thinks it could be \( 3x - 2 \). Who has the correct answer? 

###
Answers:
(A) - Only Maria 

(B) - Only Tom 

(C) - Both Maria and Tom 

(D) - Neither is correct 

###
Misconceptions:
(A) - Assumes that the value must directly correspond to a single linear transformation rather than an equation balance. 

(B) - Assumes the solution is found through manipulation without understanding the equation equality requirements. 

(C) - Assumes both provided values could satisfy the equation without verifying the correctness of either. 

(D) - Assumes all proposed values are incorrect without considering the possibility of one being valid.
