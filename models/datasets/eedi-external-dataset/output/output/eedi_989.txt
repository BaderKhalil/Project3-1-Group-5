Question: What is the total area of this composite shape made from rectangles? ![A composite shape made from two rectangles forming an L-shape. The vertical rectangle has a height of 10m and a width of 4m. The horizontal rectangle has a length of 8m and a height of 3m.]() 

###
Answers:
(A) - \( 52 \, \mathrm{m}^2 \) 

(B) - \( 42 \, \mathrm{m}^2 \) 

(C) - \( 32 \, \mathrm{m}^2 \) 

(D) - \( 46 \, \mathrm{m}^2 \) 

###
Misconceptions:
(A) - Misunderstands how to calculate area for combined shapes and adds areas incorrectly.
(B) - Miscounts the dimensions of one of the rectangles resulting in an incorrect total area.
(C) - nan 
(D) - Only includes area of one rectangle and ignores the other, leading to an incorrect calculation.
