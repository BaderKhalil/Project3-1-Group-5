Question: What is the measure of angle \( x \) in the given isosceles triangle? ![An isosceles triangle with base angles labelled as \( x \) and the vertex angle labelled as \( 40^{\degree} \)]()

###
Answers:
(A) - \( 70^{\degree} \)

(B) - \( 80^{\degree} \)

(C) - \( 40^{\degree} \)

(D) - \( 60^{\degree} \)

###
Misconceptions:
(A) - Incorrectly assumes that the sum of the base angles can be equal to the vertex angle in an isosceles triangle.

(B) - Does not apply the correct formula for the sum of the angles in a triangle.

(C) - Confuses the vertex angle with base angles in an isosceles triangle.

(D) - Correctly applies the properties of isosceles triangles to find the measure of the base angles.
