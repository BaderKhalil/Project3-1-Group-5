Question: The \( 1^{\text{st}} \) term in a linear sequence is \( 12 \).

The \( 5^{\text{th}} \) term of the sequence is \( 36 \).

What is the \( 10^{\text{th}} \) term of the sequence? 

###
Answers:
(A) - \( 60 \) 

(B) - \( 48 \) 

(C) - \( 72 \) 

(D) - \( 54 \) 

###
Misconceptions:
(A) - nan 

(B) - Misunderstands that the terms are generated by adding a constant that increases with each term, rather than a fixed difference 

(C) - Believes the pattern involves squaring the term number or some other exponentiation rather than linear growth 

(D) - Thinks that the term value can be derived by using a fixed difference multiplied by the sequence number and adjusted inaccurately
