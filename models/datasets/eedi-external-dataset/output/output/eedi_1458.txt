Question: Lisa and Mark are discussing the simplification of the expression \( \frac{4x^2 - 16}{4x} \). Lisa claims that it simplifies to \( x - 4 \), while Mark insists it simplifies to \( x - 4x^{-1} \). Who is correct? 

###
Answers:
(A) - Only Lisa 

(B) - Only Mark 

(C) - Both Lisa and Mark 

(D) - Neither is correct 

###
Misconceptions:
(A) - Lisa incorrectly assumes that both terms in the numerator can be divided by the denominator without considering common factors. 

(B) - Mark misinterprets the simplification process and incorrectly includes \( x^{-1} \) in his answer. 

(C) - This option falsely assumes that both simplifications are valid when they are not. 

(D) - This option is incorrect because at least one of them has a valid simplification.
