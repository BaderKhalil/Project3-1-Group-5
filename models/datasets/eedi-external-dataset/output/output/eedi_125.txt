Question: Which step contains an error in the proof that \( n(n+1)(n+2) \) is divisible by \( 6 \) for any integer \( n \)? 
1. \( n(n+1)(n+2) = n^3 + 3n^2 + 2n \quad \text{(Line 1)} \)  
2. \( n^3 + 3n^2 + 2n = n(n^2 + 3n + 2) \quad \text{(Line 2)} \)  
3. \( n(n^2 + 3n + 2) \) is divisible by \( 6 \quad \text{(Line 3)} \)  
### 
Answers:
(A) - Line \( 1 \) 

(B) - Line \( 2 \) 

(C) - Line \( 3 \) 

(D) - Everything is correct 

### 
Misconceptions:
(A) - Fails to distribute correctly in polynomial expansion 

(B) - Incorrectly assumes that the factors can be combined without verifying divisibility 

(C) - Misunderstands what it means for a product to be divisible by \( 6 \) 

(D) - Overlooks the need for divisibility verification in the earlier steps
