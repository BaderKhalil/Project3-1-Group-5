Question: What is the correct way to express the solution to 
\(
x^{2} + 4x - 5 \geq 0
\)? ![A quadratic parabola that opens upwards, crossing the x-axis at (-5,0) and (1,0) and the y-axis at (0, -5)]()

###
Answers:
(A) - \( \{x \leq -5\} \cup \{x \geq 1\} \)

(B) - \( \{-5 \leq x \leq 1\} \)

(C) - \( \{-5 \geq x \leq 1\} \)

(D) - \( \{x \geq -5\} \cup \{x \leq 1\} \)

###
Misconceptions:
(A) - Confuses the direction of the inequality and selects the wrong intervals.

(B) - Assumes that the inequality is strict and misinterprets the graph's intervals.

(C) - Does not accurately interpret inequality symbols in the context of solutions.

(D) - Incorrectly thinks that intervals can only be represented separately and not combined.
