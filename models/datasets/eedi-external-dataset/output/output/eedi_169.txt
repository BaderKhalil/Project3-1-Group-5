Question: A pizza shop charges a delivery fee of \( £ 5 \) and \( £ 1.50 \) for each pizza ordered. 

If \( p \) represents the number of pizzas ordered, which formula would help calculate the total cost \( (T) \) of the order? 

###
Answers:
(A) - \( T=1.50 p \) 

(B) - \( T=5+1.50 p \) 

(C) - \( T=5 p + 1.50 \) 

(D) - \( T=6.50 p \) 

###
Misconceptions:
(A) - Does not include the fixed delivery fee in the total cost calculation. 

(B) - nan 

(C) - Misplaces the coefficient with the number of pizzas when writing a formula from a given situation. 

(D) - Incorrectly combines the fixed cost and variable cost in a formula leading to an incorrect total cost.
