Question: If angle \( x \) measures 45 degrees, what is the measure of the adjacent angle \( y \) on a straight line? ![Two angles on a straight line, one is labelled 45 degrees and the other is y]() 

###
Answers:
(A) - \( 45^{\circ} \) 

(B) - \( 135^{\circ} \) 

(C) - \( 225^{\circ} \) 

(D) - \( 315^{\circ} \) 

###
Misconceptions:
(A) - Student thinks that the adjacent angle on a straight line is equal to the given angle 

(B) - Student mistakenly applies incorrect subtraction, thinking that \( 180 - 45 = 135 \) is out of the context of angles on a straight line 

(C) - Believes angles on a straight line add to 360 degrees instead of 180 degrees 

(D) - Misunderstands the concept of complementary angles, confusing angle sizes
