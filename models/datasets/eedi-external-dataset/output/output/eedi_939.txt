Question: A group of friends is planning to see a movie together. In the first row, 4 friends sit down, and they each need 2 seats for their bags. The second row has 6 friends sitting down, and they also need 2 seats each for their bags. In the third row, 8 friends sit down, and they continue to need 2 seats each for their bags. 

Alex claims that the total number of occupied seats in the 5th row will be 10 more than the 3rd row. 

Jordan argues that the total number of bags in the 5th row will be double the total number of bags in the 3rd row.

Who do you agree with? 

###
Answers:
(A) - Only Alex 

(B) - Only Jordan 

(C) - Both Alex and Jordan 

(D) - Neither is correct 

###
Misconceptions:
(A) - Misunderstands how to calculate the total seats occupied based on the pattern established. 

(B) - Misjudges the relationship between the number of bags and the number of friends by not recognizing the fixed seat requirement per friend. 

(C) - Believes that both claims about the rows follow a standard additive and multiplicative sequence without validating the specific relationships. 

(D) - Misinterprets overall calculations, thinking seats and bags are independent of the sequence when they are directly correlated.
