Question: This is a part of the table of values for the equation 
\(
y=x^{2}+4
\) 
\begin{tabular}{|c|c|}
\hline \( x \) & \( 3 \) \\
\hline \( y \) & \( \color{gold}\bigstar \) \\
\hline
\end{tabular} What should replace the star? 

###
Answers:
(A) - \( 13 \)

(B) - \( 7 \)

(C) - \( 12 \)

(D) - \( 10 \)

###
Misconceptions:
(A) - Believes the calculation of y involves only adding to or subtracting from x rather than applying the formula fully.

(B) - Confuses addition with squaring, thinking y is just \( x + 4 \).

(C) - Incorrectly applies the formula by not following proper order of operations when calculating y.

(D) - Incorrectly assumes that the output should be equal to x after some operations rather than calculating based on the function.
