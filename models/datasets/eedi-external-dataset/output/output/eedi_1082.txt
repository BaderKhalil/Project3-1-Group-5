Question: Sarah and Jake are examining the function \( \boldsymbol{y}=\boldsymbol{x}^{\mathbf{2}} \) \begin{tabular}{|l|l|}
\hline\( x \) & \(\color{gold}\bigstar\) \\
\hline\( y \) & \( 16 \) \\
\hline
\end{tabular} Sarah argues the star could be \( 4 \).

Jake argues the star could be \( -4 \).

Who is correct? 

###
Answers:
(A) - Only Sarah 

(B) - Only Jake 

(C) - Both Sarah and Jake 

(D) - Neither is correct 

###
Misconceptions:
(A) - Thinks that the function produces identical output for both positive and negative inputs due to squaring. 

(B) - Believes that negative inputs cannot produce a positive output in a squared equation.

(C) - Assumes that the results of a squared function can yield more than one valid input for the same output.

(D) - Incorrectly thinks that there are no valid inputs that can give the stated y value of 16 for a squared function.
