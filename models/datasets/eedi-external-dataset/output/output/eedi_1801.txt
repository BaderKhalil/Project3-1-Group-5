Question: What is the solution to the following inequality?
\(
3 < -2x + 7 < 11
\) 

###
Answers:
(A) - \( -2 < x < -4 \) 

(B) - \( -1 < x < 2 \) 

(C) - \( 1 < x < 4 \) 

(D) - \( 1 < x < -2 \) 

###
Misconceptions:
(A) - Confuses the sign of \(x\) due to incorrect direction of inequality when isolating \(x\).

(B) - Incorrectly believes that the algebraic manipulation does not affect the inequality's direction.

(C) - Miscalculates the result for \(x\) by not properly isolating it before evaluating the inequality.

(D) - Mistakenly assumes that \(x\) can be greater than 1 and less than -2 simultaneously, leading to an impossible solution.
