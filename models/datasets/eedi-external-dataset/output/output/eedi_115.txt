Question: A point at coordinates (2, -4) is translated 6 units to the left and 3 units up in vector notation. What should replace the \( \triangle \) in \( \left(\begin{array}{c}\triangle \\ \bigcirc\end{array}\right) \) for this translation?

###
Answers:
(A) - \( 6 \)

(B) - \( -6 \)

(C) - \( 3 \)

(D) - \( -3 \)

Misconceptions:
(A) - Thinks that a positive number in a column vector indicates movement to the left rather than to the right.

(B) - nan

(C) - Thinks that the movement of the top number in a column vector is for horizontal translation rather than vertical translation.

(D) - Thinks that negative movement means moving in the positive direction instead of the correct negative direction.
