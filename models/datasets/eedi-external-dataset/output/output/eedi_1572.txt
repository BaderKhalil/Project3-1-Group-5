Question: A square is reflected across the line \( y = x + 2 \). What are the new coordinates of the vertex at \( (1, 1) \) after the reflection? 

###
Answers:
(A) - \( (0, 3) \)

(B) - \( (3, 0) \) 

(C) - \( (4, -1) \) 

(D) - \( (-1, 5) \) 

###
Misconceptions:

(C) - Miscalculates the distance from the line of reflection 

(D) - Fails to reflect across the correct line of reflection
