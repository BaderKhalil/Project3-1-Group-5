Question: Use the graph to approximate the solution to \( x^{2}-4x+3>0 \) ![A set of axes with the quadratic graph y=x^2-4x+3 drawn on.]() 

###
Answers:
(A) - \( x<1, x>3 \) 

(B) - \( 1<x<3 \) 

(C) - \( x=1 \) 

(D) - \( x>3 \) 

###
Misconceptions:
(A) - Selects the correct intervals but does not include the endpoints, which may lead to missing solutions if not interpreted carefully.

(B) - Incorrectly selects the range between the roots rather than outside, missing values where the quadratic is positive.

(C) - Identifies a single point rather than the intervals where the quadratic inequality holds true.

(D) - Only includes part of the solution and ignores the left side interval, leading to an incomplete interpretation.
