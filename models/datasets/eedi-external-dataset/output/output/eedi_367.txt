Question: ![A diagram showing a horizontal line across the middle of a grid, intersecting a green triangle located below the line. The triangle has vertices A (1 unit left from the vertical center line, 2 units down), B (2 units right from the vertical center line, 2 units down), and C (0 units from the vertical center line, 5 units down). The horizontal line acts as a mirror. The triangle is being reflected across the horizontal line. ]() Sam and Alex are discussing reflections.

Sam claims that if the triangle is reflected in the horizontal line, Point \( A \) moves to the same vertical position as Point \( C \).

Alex argues that when the triangle is reflected in the horizontal line, Point \( B \) stays in the same position.

Who is correct? 

###
Answers:
(A) - Only Sam

(B) - Only Alex 

(C) - Both Sam and Alex 

(D) - Neither is correct 

###
Misconceptions:
(A) - Fails to account for the vertical movement of Point A after reflection 

(B) - Assumes that points on the mirror line do not change position when reflected 

(C) - Fails to recognize the rules of reflection properly

(D) - Fails to recognize the rules of reflection properly
