Question: What is the measure of each interior angle in a regular octagon? 

###
Answers:
(A) - \( 120^{\degree} \) 

(B) - \( 135^{\degree} \) 

(C) - \( 150^{\degree} \) 

(D) - \( 180^{\degree} \)

###
Misconceptions:
(A) - Believes that the angles of a polygon with 8 sides average to 120 degrees 

(B) - Thinks that regular octagons have the same angle as squares 

(C) - Confuses the calculation for an octagon with that of a different polygon 

(D) - Assumes that all interior angles are straight angles
