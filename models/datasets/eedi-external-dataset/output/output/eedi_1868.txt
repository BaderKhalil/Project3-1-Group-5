Question: Mia and Kevin are discussing the transformation of shape \( R \) to shape \( S \)

Mia states: "It’s a \( 180^{\degree} \) rotation clockwise"

Kevin argues: "No, it’s a rotation of \( -180^{\degree} \) about the point \( (2,-3) \)"

Which one of them is correct? ![A coordinate plane showing two pentagons with a center of rotation clearly marked at (2,-3). Pentagonal shape R has the coordinates: (0,0), (2,0), (3,1), (1,2), and (0,1). Pentagonal shape S has the coordinates: (4,-3), (2,-3), (1,-2), (3,-1), and (4,-2).]()

###
Answers:
(A) - Only Mia

(B) - Only Kevin 

(C) - Both Mia and Kevin 

(D) - Neither is correct 

###
Misconceptions:
(A) - Misunderstands the angle and direction of rotation 

(B) - Correctly identifies the negative rotation but fails to recognize that both +- and -180° represent the same physical rotation 

(C) - Misunderstands the angle and direction of rotation 

(D) - Does not consider the relation between clockwise and counterclockwise rotations
