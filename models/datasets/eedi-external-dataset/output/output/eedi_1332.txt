        Question: ![A straight line is divided by angle m and 75 degrees, find the measure of angle m]() What is the measure of angle \( m \)?

        ###
        Answers:
        (A) - \( 105^{\circ} \) 

        (B) - \( 65^{\circ} \) 

        (C) - \( 90^{\circ} \) 

        (D) - \( 255^{\circ} \) 

        ###
        Misconceptions:
        (A) - Correct understanding that angles on a straight line must add up to 180 degrees. 

        (B) - Might confuse the values and think that subtracting from 75 gives angles on a different type of straight line. 

        (C) - Believes that angles can be equal to the right angle and forgets to consider the total of 180 degrees.

        (D) - Thinks all angles along a straight line add up to 360 degrees, misapplying angle addition principles.
