Question: How many degrees are there in \( 2 \frac{1}{2} \) full turns?

###
Answers:
(A) - \( 900^{\circ} \) 

(B) - \( 720^{\circ} \) 

(C) - \( 450^{\circ} \) 

(D) - \( 180^{\circ} \) 

###
Misconceptions:
(A) - Believes that 2.5 turns equate to 2 times \( 360^{\circ} \) plus an additional \( 180^{\circ} \).

(B) - Calculates only two complete \( 360^{\circ} \) turns without accounting for the additional half turn.

(C) - Thinks \( 450^{\circ} \) represents two and a quarter turns, mistakenly counting increments incorrectly.

(D) - Incorrectly believes that any fraction of a turn only accounts for \( 180^{\circ} \) as a half turn.
