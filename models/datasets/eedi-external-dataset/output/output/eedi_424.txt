        Answers:
        (A) - \( 31.4 \mathrm{~cm} \) 

        (B) - \( 20 \mathrm{~cm} \) 

        (C) - \( 10 \mathrm{~cm} \) 

        (D) - \( 15.7 \mathrm{~cm} \)

        Misconceptions:
        (A) - Correct answer, but misunderstanding about how π is applied in the calculation.
        
        (B) - Uses the diameter directly without multiplying by π.
        
        (C) - Confuses circumference with radius; thinks diameter equals circumference.
        
        (D) - Adds 5 instead of performing the correct multiplication.
