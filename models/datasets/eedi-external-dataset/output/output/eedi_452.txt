Question: Which region would \( x^{2}+6x+9=0 \) belong? ![A Venn diagram made up of two overlapping circles. One is labelled 'Factorises' and the other is labelled 'Has two distinct solutions'.
A is in the 'Factorises' circle only, B is in the overlap of the two circles, C is in the 'Has two distinct solutions' circle only, and D is outside the circles.]() 

###
Answers:
(A) - A 

(B) - B 

(C) - C 

(D) - D 

###
Misconceptions:
(A) - Believes that the equation only intersects the x-axis at one point. 

(B) - Believes the equation can be factored but also has two distinct solutions. 

(C) - Assumes all quadratic equations that can be factored yield two distinct solutions. 

(D) - nan
