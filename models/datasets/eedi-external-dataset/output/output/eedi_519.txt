Question: When this expression is fully factorised, what is left inside the brackets? \( 18 x^2y - 12 xy^2 \equiv 6xy(\square) \)

###
Answers:
(A) - \( 3 x - 2 y \)

(B) - \( 3 xy - 2y \)

(C) - \( 3 x^2 - 2 y^2 \)

(D) - \( 3 x - 2 \)

###
Misconceptions:
(A) - Confuses how to factor out the common factors from both terms.

(B) - Misunderstands how to combine like terms correctly after taking out the common factor.

(C) - Incorrectly applies the difference of squares without relevant factors being present.

(D) - Neglects to account for the common variables when simplifying the expression.
