Question: Problem P: \( 7 + 3 \times 4 = \)
Problem Q: \( 10 - 2 + 6 = \)

Which operation should you perform first in each problem?

###
Answers:
(A) - Problem P: \( 7 + 3 \) 
Problem Q: \( 10 - 2 \) 

(B) - Problem P: \( 3 \times 4 \)
Problem Q: \( -2 + 6 \)

(C) - Problem P: \( 7 + 4 \)
Problem Q: \( 10 + 6 \)

(D) - Problem P: \( 3 \times 4 \)
Problem Q: \( 2 + 6 \)

###
Misconceptions:
(A) - Ignores the priority of multiplication over addition 

(B) - Correctly identifies the operation needed for Problem P but overlooks the need to address the addition first in Problem Q

(C) - Incorrectly combines terms rather than applying the correct order of operations
