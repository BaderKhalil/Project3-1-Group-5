Question: ![A triangle drawn on a coordinate grid with vertices labelled (2,3), (8,3), and (5,7). The base is represented by an arrow between (2,3) and (8,3).]() What is the length of the base of this triangle as indicated by the arrow? 

###
Answers:
(A) - \( 6 \) 

(B) - \( 5 \) 

(C) - \( 8 \) 

(D) - \( 10 \) 

###
Misconceptions:
(A) - Assumes the base length is calculated incorrectly using one of the other triangle segments 

(B) - Confuses base length with height of the triangle 

(C) - Does not understand how to correctly measure the distance between the two points 

(D) - Miscalculates by incorrectly adding coordinates instead of finding the difference
