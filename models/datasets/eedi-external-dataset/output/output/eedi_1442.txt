Question: A square is rotated 90 degrees clockwise around the origin. What are the new coordinates of point \( Q \) which is at \( (3, 4) \)? ![A set of axes with a square placed in the first quadrant, one vertex is labeled with point \( Q \) at coordinates (3, 4).]()

###
Answers:
(A) - \( (4, -3) \)

(B) - \( (4, 3) \)

(C) - \( (-3, 4) \)

(D) - \( (3, -4) \)

###
Misconceptions:
(A) - Believes that rotation changes the signs of both coordinates.

(B) - Believes that rotation has no effect on the y-coordinate.

(C) - Believes that the rotation moves points symmetrically around the y-axis.

(D) - Believes that rotation only affects the y-coordinates, leaving the x-coordinate unchanged.
