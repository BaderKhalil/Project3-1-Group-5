Question: What is the size of angle \( p \) ? ![A straight line intersects another line creating two angles, p on the left and 75 degrees on the right. The straight line also creates an angle of 105 degrees with a different line at the bottom.]() 

###
Answers:
(A) - \( 30^{\circ} \) 

(B) - \( 75^{\circ} \) 

(C) - \( 105^{\circ} \) 

(D) - \( 45^{\circ} \) 

###
Misconceptions:
(A) - Thinks the angles formed by the intersection will always be half of their adjacent angles

(B) - Assumes all angles labeled are equivalent without considering their relationships

(C) - Misinterprets the meaning of angles on a straight line angle fact 

(D) - Calculates angle incorrectly by not applying the supplementary angle rule properly
