Question: Which of the following describes the area of a rectangle formed by a sequence of increasingly larger squares? For example, if the first square has a side length of 1, the second square has a side length of 2, and the third square has a side length of 3, what is the general formula for the area of the rectangles formed?

###
Answers:
(A) - n 

(B) - n^2 

(C) - n(n + 1) 

(D) - 2n 

###
Misconceptions:
(A) - Does not recognize that the area is related to the square of the side length, not just the length itself

(B) - Correctly identifies the relationship between the side length and area for squares, but fails to understand the nature of rectangles formed by increasing side lengths

(C) - Misunderstands the relationship of consecutive side lengths in terms of area growth, as this formula incorrectly represents the area of rectangles with length and width

(D) - Misinterprets the area formula by introducing an incorrect multiplier, thinking of it as linear instead of quadratic
