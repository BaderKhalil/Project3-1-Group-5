Question: Solve the equation:
\(
3 x = \frac{3}{4}
\) 

###
Answers:
(A) - \( x = \frac{1}{4} \) 

(B) - \( x = \frac{1}{2} \) 

(C) - \( x = 1 \) 

(D) - \( x = \frac{1}{8} \) 

###
Misconceptions:
(A) - Assumes that \( x \) can be found by directly dividing numerator or ignoring the operation's effect on the equation. 

(B) - Confuses the relationship between multiplication and division, assuming a miscalculation in manipulating the equation. 

(C) - Misinterprets the solution by not correctly applying the multiplicative inverse to both sides of the equation. 

(D) - Miscalculates the fraction and fails to apply the correct division of both sides appropriately.
