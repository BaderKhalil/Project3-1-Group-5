Question: Which of the following quadrilaterals has the same area as a triangle with a base of 10 and height of 6? ![A triangle where base = 10 and height = 6]()

###
Answers:
(A) - ![A parallelogram with a base of 10 and a height of 6]()

(B) - ![A rectangle with a length of 10 and a width of 6]()

(C) - ![A rhombus with a diagonal of 10 and a diagonal of 12]()

(D) - ![A trapezoid with bases of 10 and 12, and height of 6]()

###
Misconceptions:
(A) - Correctly calculates area but mistakenly assumes parallelograms with the same base and height as triangles have equal areas without verifying dimensions. 

(B) - Calculates area of rectangles correctly but misrepresents area equivalence to triangles without considering division by 2.

(C) - Misunderstands how to calculate area of a rhombus and assumes it equates to that of the triangle.

(D) - Fails to correctly apply the trapezoid area formula and assumes it equals the area of the triangle.
