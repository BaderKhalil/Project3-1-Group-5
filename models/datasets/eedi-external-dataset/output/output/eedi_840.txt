Question: Calculate the value of \(x\) in the equation:
\(
3(x + 4) = 21
\)

Sam claims a correct next step could be: \(x + 4 = 7\) 
Alex claims a correct next step could be: \(3x + 4 = 21\) 
Which statement is correct?

###
Answers:
(A) - Only Sam 

(B) - Only Alex 

(C) - Both Sam and Alex 

(D) - Neither is correct 

###
Misconceptions:
(A) - Incorrectly assumes division only applies to the entire equation, without addressing distribution. 

(B) - Misunderstands the distributive property and assumes the coefficient applies to \(x\) only. 

(C) - Assumes both statements are valid when one misapplies the properties of equations. 

(D) - Ignores that operations should apply equally across the equation when simplifying.
