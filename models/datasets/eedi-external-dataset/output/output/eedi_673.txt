Question: A square is reflected in the dashed line. What are the new coordinates of point \( \mathrm{Q} \) ? ![A coordinate grid with the reflection line y=-x drawn and a square with the coordinates (1,1), (1,3), (3,1), and (3,3). Q is the point (1,3)]() 

###
Answers:
(A) - \( (-3,1) \) 

(B) - \( (-1,-3) \) 

(C) - \( (-3,-1) \) 

(D) - \( (-1,3) \) 

###
Misconceptions:
(A) - Misinterprets the reflection process resulting in inversion of points 

(B) - Confuses the coordinates when reflecting, leading to incorrect signs being assigned 

(C) - Reflects one coordinate correctly but fails on the other coordinate 

(D) - Changes the y-coordinate incorrectly without reflecting across the line
