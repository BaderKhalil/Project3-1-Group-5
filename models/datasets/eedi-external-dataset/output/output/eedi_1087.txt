Question: If angles A and B are supplementary and angle A is \( 110^{\circ} \), what is the measure of angle B? ![A straight line formed by angles A and B, one labeled 110 degrees and the other B]()

###
Answers:
(A) - \( 70^{\circ} \) 

(B) - \( 90^{\circ} \) 

(C) - \( 100^{\circ} \) 

(D) - \( 180^{\circ} \) 

###
Misconceptions:
(A) - Misunderstands supplementary angles as needing to be complementary instead 

(B) - Incorrectly believes that 90 degrees is the complement without considering supplementary constraints 

(C) - Does not recognize that supplementary angles sum to 180 degrees 

(D) - Confuses the definition of supplementary angle as being equal to \( 180^{\circ} \) rather than understanding it as the total of two angles
