Question: ![An equation represented with arrows: the first arrow has ' + 4' in it, and the second arrow has ' รท 2' in it.]() The rule above is used to create a term-to-term sequence. If the fifth term is \( 36 \), what is the first term?

###
Answers:
(A) - \( 8 \) 

(B) - \( 10 \) 

(C) - \( 14 \) 

(D) - \( 18 \) 

###
Misconceptions:
(A) - Miscalculates the effect of operations and assumes a lower term will yield a higher first term

(B) - Confuses the sequence operations and adds instead of applying both rules correctly

(C) - Correct answer, understands the operations of the sequence clearly 

(D) - Thinks that term sequences must always end in an even number
