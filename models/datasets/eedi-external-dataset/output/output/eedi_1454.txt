Question: A bookstore sells three types of notebooks and two types of pens for a total of \( £ 5.50 \). Additionally, two types of notebooks and four types of pens cost £7.00. What is the cost of one type of notebook and one type of pen? 

###
Answers:
(A) - \( \begin{array}{l}\text { Notebook }=£ 1.10 \\ \text { pen }=£ 1.20\end{array} \)

(B) - \( \begin{array}{l}\text { Notebook }=£ 0.80 \\ \text { pen }=£ 1.30\end{array} \)

(C) - \( \begin{array}{l}\text { Notebook }=£ 0.50, \\ \text { pen }=£ 2.00\end{array} \)

(D) - \( \begin{array}{l}\text { Notebook }=£ 1.00 \\ \text { pen }=£ 2.00\end{array} \)

###
Misconceptions:
(A) - The student believes the values add up to the total correctly, without checking against both equations.

(B) - The student miscalculated by not applying the correct ratios from both equations, leading to incorrect values.

(C) - The student assumed arbitrary values without solving the system of equations properly.

(D) - The student incorrectly equated total costs from one equation without verifying consistency with the second equation.
