Question: Sarah rides her bicycle to the store at a constant speed, stops to shop, and then rides back home at a constant speed. Which of the following displacement \( (d) \) time \( (t) \) graphs is most likely to illustrate Sarah's journey?

###
Answers:
(A) - ![The graph has three sections.
The first section starts at (0, 0) and is a horizontal line, then a steeply sloped line with negative gradient. The last section is another horizontal line.]() 

(B) - ![The graph has three sections.
The first section starts at (0, 0) and is a sloped line with a gentle positive gradient, then a horizontal line. The third section has a steeply sloped line with positive gradient.]() 

(C) - ![The graph has three sections.
The first section starts at (0, 0) and is a sloped line with a steep positive gradient, then a horizontal line. The third section is a horizontal line as well.]() 

(D) - ![The graph has three sections.
The first section is a sloped line with steep, positive, uphill gradient that starts at (0, 0), then a horizontal line. The third section is a sloped line with a gentle negative gradient.]() 

###
Misconceptions:
(A) - Believes that standing still results in an increase in displacement 

(B) - Believes that less steep gradients indicate a faster speed during the return trip 

(C) - Thinks that displacement remains constant while returning to the starting point 

(D) - nan
