Question: Which diagram shows the fraction that is the smallest?

###
Answers:
(A) - ![A circle divided into 8 equal sections, where 3 sections are shaded green and 5 are white.]() 

(B) - ![A triangle divided into 6 smaller triangles, where 2 are shaded blue and 4 are white.]() 

(C) - ![A square divided into 10 equal squares, where 1 square is shaded red and 9 are white.]() 

(D) - ![A rectangle divided into 4 smaller rectangles, where 1 is shaded yellow and 3 are white.]() 

###
Misconceptions:
(A) - Believes that even though there are more sections, it represents a smaller fraction when comparing shaded parts.

(B) - Thinks that a larger number of triangles means the fraction is larger, ignoring the size of shaded parts in relation to the total.

(C) - Assumes that shading more squares automatically gives a larger fraction, while not recognizing the size of the parts shaded. 

(D) - Thinks that because fewer rectangles are shaded, it represents a smaller fraction without regard for the total number of sections.
