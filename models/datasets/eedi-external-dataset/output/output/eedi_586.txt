###
Misconceptions:
(A) - When simplifying surds, incorrectly identifies the proper square number to factor out, leading to an inaccurate final answer. 

(B) - Fails to factor \( \sqrt{72} \) correctly; simplifies the expression to an entirely new surd rather than a simplified one. 

(C) - nan 

(D) - When simplifying surds, does not simplify \( \sqrt{18} \) further to obtain the simplest form.
