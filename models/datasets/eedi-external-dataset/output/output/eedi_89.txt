Question: What is the first term of the sequence defined by the rule:
\[
3n - 7
\]

###
Answers:
(A) - \( -7 \)

(B) - \( -4 \)

(C) - \( 3 \)

(D) - \( 0 \)

###
Misconceptions:
(A) - Thinks the first term is simply the constant term of the equation.

(B) - Misunderstands that the first term should be obtained by substituting \( n = 1 \) and calculates incorrectly.

(C) - Assumes the first term of the sequence is the coefficient of \( n \).

(D) - Thinks that the first term will yield a positive number by not properly substituting \( n \) into the equation.
