Question: What function machine represents the equation \( y = 3x + 7 \)?

###
Answers:
(A) - ![A function machine which has 3 parts joined by arrows pointing from left to right. "ùë•" is the first part, written on the left, followed by a horizontal arrow pointing to a rectangle that has "3" written inside it, followed by a horizontal arrow pointing to a rectangle that has "+ 7" written inside it, followed by a horizontal arrow pointing to "y".]() 

(B) - ![A function machine which has 3 parts joined by arrows pointing from left to right. "ùë•" is the first part, written on the left, followed by a horizontal arrow pointing to a rectangle that has "+ 7" written inside it, followed by a horizontal arrow pointing to a rectangle that has "3" written inside it, followed by a horizontal arrow pointing to "y".]() 

(C) - ![A function machine which has 3 parts joined by arrows pointing from left to right. "ùë•" is the first part, written on the left, followed by a horizontal arrow pointing to a rectangle that has "‚úï 3" written inside it, followed by a horizontal arrow pointing to a rectangle that has "+ 7" written inside it, followed by a horizontal arrow pointing to "y".]() 

(D) - ![A function machine which has 3 parts joined by arrows pointing from left to right. "y" is the first part, written on the left, followed by a horizontal arrow pointing to a rectangle that has "3" written inside it, followed by a horizontal arrow pointing to a rectangle that has "+ 7" written inside it, followed by a horizontal arrow pointing to "ùë•".]()

Misconceptions:
(A) - Correctly identifies the operations but may misunderstand the representation of the input and output. 

(B) - Misplaces the order of operations by adding 7 before multiplying by 3, which reverses the required calculations.

(C) - Correctly shows multiplying by 3 but does not explicitly denote it as an addition operation, leading to potential misinterpretation. 

(D) - Confuses the roles of input and output in a function machine, mistakenly starting with the output instead of the input.
