Question: In a trapezium with parallel sides measuring \( 8 \mathrm{~cm} \) and \( 4 \mathrm{~cm} \), and the perpendicular height is \( 3 \mathrm{~cm} \), what is the area of the trapezium using the formula: Area \( = \left(\frac{a+b}{2}\right) h \)?

###
Answers:
(A) - \( 12 \mathrm{~cm}^2 \)

(B) - \( 24 \mathrm{~cm}^2 \)

(C) - \( 15 \mathrm{~cm}^2 \)

(D) - \( 10 \mathrm{~cm}^2 \)

###
Misconceptions:
(A) - nan 

(B) - Miscalculates the area by mistakenly multiplying the values instead of averaging the lengths of the parallel sides 

(C) - Incorrectly uses the wrong formula or values leading to an inaccurate area calculation 

(D) - Misunderstands the formula by neglecting to average the two bases
