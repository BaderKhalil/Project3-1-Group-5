Question: Sarah and Mike are discussing the characteristics of perpendicular lines.

Sarah claims that \( \boldsymbol{y}=\mathbf{3 x}+\mathbf{4} \) and \( \boldsymbol{y}=\mathbf{-\frac{1}{3} x}+\mathbf{1} \) are perpendicular.

Mike argues that \( \boldsymbol{y}=\mathbf{4 x}+3 \) and \( \boldsymbol{y}=\mathbf{-\frac{1}{4} x}-2 \) are perpendicular.

Who is right?

###
Answers:
(A) - Only Sarah 

(B) - Only Mike 

(C) - Both Sarah and Mike 

(D) - Neither is correct 

###
Misconceptions:
(A) - Misunderstands that only the product of slopes must equal -1 for lines to be perpendicular 

(B) - Incorrectly believes both pairs of lines meet the perpendicularity condition 

(C) - Thinks that both sets of lines can meet the condition for perpendicularity 

(D) - Believes neither pair of lines fulfills the requirement for perpendicularity
