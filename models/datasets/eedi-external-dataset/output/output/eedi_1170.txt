Question: In a right-angled triangle with legs \( a \) and \( b \) and hypotenuse \( c \), determine which equation can be used to find the length of leg \( b \). ![Right-angled triangle with height a, base b and hypotenuse c.]() 

###
Answers:
(A) - \( b^2 = c^2 + a^2 \) 

(B) - \( b = \sqrt{c^2 - a^2} \) 

(C) - \( b^2 = a^2 - c^2 \) 

(D) - \( b^2 = c^2 - a^2 \) 

###
Misconceptions:
(A) - Confuses adding the squares of the legs with the Pythagorean theorem, thinking it applies in reverse. 

(B) - nan 

(C) - Assumes that the subtraction in the equation applies to squares in a different order than how the Pythagorean theorem dictates. 

(D) - nan
