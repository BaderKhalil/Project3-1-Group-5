Question: Lucy and Ben are solving equations involving absolute values.
Lucy states that \( |x - 3| = 5 \) yields \( x = 8 \) and \( x = -2 \).
Ben claims that \( |x + 4| = 6 \) produces \( x = 2 \) and \( x = -10 \).
Who is correct?

###
Answers:
(A) - Only Lucy 

(B) - Only Ben 

(C) - Both Lucy and Ben 

(D) - Neither is correct 

###
Misconceptions:
(A) - Thinks Lucy has correctly identified both solutions of her absolute value equation when she actually missed one. 

(B) - Believes Ben's solutions are accurate, when in fact he has miscalculated one solution. 

(C) - Assumes both pairs of solutions from Lucy and Ben are correct without verifying the absolute value principles. 

(D) - Is unaware that both made mistakes regarding the solutions of absolute value equations.
