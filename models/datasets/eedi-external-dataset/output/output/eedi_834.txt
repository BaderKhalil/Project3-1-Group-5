Question: What is the missing term in the factorised expression \( (x+5) \square \) when factorising \( x^{2}+10x+25 \)? 

###
Answers:
(A) - \( (x+5) \) 

(B) - \( (x+10) \) 

(C) - \( (x+2) \) 

(D) - \( (x-5) \) 

###
Misconceptions:
(A) - Assumes that the expression is a perfect square but doesn’t consider the full factorisation structure 

(B) - Misunderstands that \( b \) in the quadratic formula represents the sum of roots rather than the number being used to factor 

(C) - Incorrectly thinks that the roots are found by adding the coefficients rather than recognizing the relationship between coefficients and roots 

(D) - Fails to recognize that subtracting a value leads to a difference rather than a suitable factor in this scenario
