Question: Factorise this expression, if possible:
\(
x^{2}-5x+6
\) 

###
Answers:
(A) - \( (x-3)(x-2) \) 

(B) - \( (x-6)(x+1) \) 

(C) - \( (x-5)(x+1) \) 

(D) - Does not factorise 

###
Misconceptions:
(A) - Believes that the product of the numbers in the brackets should equal the constant term but doesn’t check if they add up correctly to the coefficient of x. 

(B) - Believes that the numbers in the brackets can be chosen freely without consideration of both the sum and product relating to the quadratic. 

(C) - Believes that the two numbers must add to give the constant, instead of focusing on their relationship with the coefficient of x. 

(D) - nan
