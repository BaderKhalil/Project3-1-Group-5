        Question: A sequence is defined using the rule

Multiply the position by \( 3 \) and then subtract \( 2 \)

What is the second term in the sequence? 

        ###
        Answers:
        (A) - \( 4 \) 

        (B) - \( 5 \) 

        (C) - \( 1 \) 

        (D) - \( 2 \) 

        ###
        Misconceptions:
        (A) - nan 

        (B) - Confuses the operation and adds instead of subtracts 

        (C) - Takes the previous term instead of calculating the current term 

        (D) - Misremembers the operation, thinking to apply only subtraction without multiplication
