Question: Sarah and Mike are comparing their approaches to simple calculations. Sarah states that if \( 5678 + 432 = 6110 \), then \( 5678 + 434 \) must equal \( \mathbf{6 1 1 2} \). Mike claims that if \( 5678 - 432 = 5246 \), then \( 5678 - 434 \) must equal \( \mathbf{5 2 4 4} \). Who is correct?
