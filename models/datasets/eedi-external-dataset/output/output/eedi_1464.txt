Question: Aisha is tracking her bike ride starting from a park. The graph on the right shows Aisha's distance in kilometres \( (d) \) over time in hours \( (t) \).

The gradient of the positive sloping section of the graph is \( 4 \).

Which of the following does that \( 4 \) best represent? ![A sketch of a graph with d on the y-axis and t on the x-axis. A straight line slopes upwards from the origin, strong upwards slanting indicating a steep incline.]() 

###
Answers:
(A) - Aisha is cycling towards the park at a speed of \( 4 \mathrm{~km/h} \) 

(B) - Aisha is accelerating at a rate of \( 4 \mathrm{~km/h} \) 

(C) - Aisha is travelling away from the park at a speed of \( 4 \mathrm{~km/h} \) 

(D) - Aisha is biking towards the park at a speed of \( 4 \mathrm{~km/h} \) 

###
Misconceptions:
(A) - Believes that a steep incline in a distance-time graph means travelling away 

(B) - Misunderstands that the value given represents acceleration rather than speed 

(C) - Confuses the direction of movement based on the character of the graph 

(D) - nan
