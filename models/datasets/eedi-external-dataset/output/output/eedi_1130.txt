Question: Determine the value of \( y \) in the triangle where the angles are \( 3y, 2y + 30 \), and \( y - 24 \). 

###
Answers:
(A) - \( y=20^{\circ} \) 

(B) - \( y=18^{\circ} \) 

(C) - \( y=12^{\circ} \) 

(D) - \( y=44^{\circ} \) 

###
Misconceptions:
(A) - nan 

(B) - Incorrectly assumes that the sum of the angles is 180 degrees but miscalculates the value of \( y \). 

(C) - Forgetting to account for the constraints of angle measures resulting in a negative value for one angle. 

(D) - Uses the wrong total for the sum of the angles in the triangle, calculating beyond 180 degrees.
