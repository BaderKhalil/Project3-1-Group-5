Question: In which region would \( x=3.2 \) belong? ![A Venn diagram made up of two overlapping circles. One circle is labelled \( x - 3.2 < 0 \) and the other circle is labelled \( -3.2 < x + 1 \).
A is in the \( x - 3.2 < 0 \) circle only.
B is in the overlap of the two circles.
C is in the \( -3.2 < x + 1 \) circle only.
D is outside both circles.]()

###
Answers:
(A) - A 

(B) - B 

(C) - C 

(D) - D 

###
Misconceptions:
(A) - nan 

(B) - Believes that the solution of the inequality includes the endpoint leading to an incorrect overlap. 

(C) - Misunderstands that being in this circle means \( x \) is less than the boundary. 

(D) - nan
