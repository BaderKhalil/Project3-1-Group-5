Question: A table is given for the line described by \( y = \frac{1}{2}x - 4 \). What value should be entered in the box for \( y \) when \( x = 6 \)? ![\begin{tabular}{l|l|l|c}
\( x \) & & \( 2 \) & \( 6 \) \\
\hline\( y \) & \( -3 \) & \( ? \) &  \\
\end{tabular}]() 

###
Answers:
(A) - \( -1 \) 

(B) - \( -2 \) 

(C) - \( -4 \) 

(D) - \( 0 \) 

###
Misconceptions:
(A) - Thinks that the graph will always pass through the y-axis in a linear fashion, neglecting the slope and intercept values. 

(B) - Incorrectly assumes that plugging in \( x \) leads to positive results without calculating properly. 

(C) - Incorrectly tries to compute \( y \) by only using the first value \( -3 \) without any comparison to the given equation.

(D) - Misunderstands how to substitute values into linear equations and assumes the output is always zero.
