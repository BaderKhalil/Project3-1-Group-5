Question: Which of the following is the most likely graph of a quadratic function?

###
Answers:
(A) - ![A U-shaped curve that opens upwards, starting from below the x-axis in the left quadrant and rising steeply before reaching a vertex at the origin, then continuing to rise as it moves to the right.]()

(B) - ![A straight line that extends with a positive slope, crossing the y-axis above the origin and continuing infinitely in the first quadrant.]()

(C) - ![A downward-opening U-shaped curve, starting above the x-axis in the left quadrant, peaking at a point to the right of the y-axis, and then descending steeply to the x-axis as it moves right.]()

(D) - ![An exponential curve that starts below the x-axis, gradually steepening as it rises, crossing the y-axis just above the origin and continuing to rise steeply to the right.]()
