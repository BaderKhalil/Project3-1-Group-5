Question: Sarah and John are trying to solve the equation \( v=3w-12 \) for \( w \). 
Sarah proposes starting the rearrangement with \( v+12=3w \) while John suggests \( w=\frac{v-12}{3} \).
Who is correct?

###
Answers:
(A) - Only Sarah 

(B) - Only John 

(C) - Both Sarah and John 

(D) - Neither is correct 

###
Misconceptions:
(A) - Believes that adding to both sides allows the variable to be isolated incorrectly, neglecting the multiplication factor. 

(B) - Understands correct rearrangement but may misinterpret that the equation needs to be simplified further than necessary. 

(C) - Thinks that both methods are equally valid when they are not, leading to different interpretations of \( w \).

(D) - nan
