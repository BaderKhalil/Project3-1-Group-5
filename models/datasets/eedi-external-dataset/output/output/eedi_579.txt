At what time does City A have a higher temperature than City B? ![A graph showing Temperature (°F) on the y axis and Time (hours) on the x axis. Y axis from 0 to 100, each square goes up by 10, and x axis from 0 to 24, each square goes up by 2. A blue line slopes upward from left to right, showing temperature trends for City B. A red line slopes upward from left to right, showing temperature trends for City A.]()
