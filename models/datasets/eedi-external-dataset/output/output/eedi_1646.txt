Question: In the diagram, several angles are given: \(x\), \(3x + 20\), and \(100 - x\). What can you conclude from these angles? ![Angles around a point split into three parts with the parts labelled: x, 3x + 20, and 100 - x]() 

###
Answers:
(A) - \( x + 3x + 20 = 100 \)

(B) - \( x + (100 - x) = 20 \)

(C) - \( 3x + 20 + (100 - x) = 360 \)

(D) - \( x + 3x + 20 = 360 \)

###
Misconceptions:
(A) - Miscalculates the relationship between the angles, treating the equation incorrectly rather than using the full circle angle sum.

(B) - Incorrectly sets up the equation, confusing angle measures with complementary relationships.

(C) - Misunderstands the total angle measurement; it should be equated to \( 180 \) degrees, not \( 360 \).

(D) - Incorrectly adds the angle measures thinking they sum to the full circle rather than the interior angles around a point.
