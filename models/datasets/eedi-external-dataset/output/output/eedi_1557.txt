Question: What is the correct point for \( F \) when reflected in the line \( y=2 \) ? ![A 4 quadrant, coordinate grid with a triangle drawn on it with the coordinates (2,4) (3,5) and (1,5). F is the point (3,5)]() 

###
Answers:
(A) - A is the coordinate (3,-1) 

(B) - B is the coordinate (3,0) 

(C) - C is the coordinate (3,6) 

(D) - None of these 

###
Misconceptions:
(A) - Thinks reflection across the line shifts the point downwards along the y-axis. 

(B) - Confuses reflecting above the line by moving it downward to the x-axis. 

(C) - Incorrectly draws the point above the line instead of reflecting it accordingly. 

(D) - nan
