Question: What is the area of the shaded region in this composite shape formed by two overlapping rectangles? ![A composite shape where two rectangles overlap creating a cross-like structure. The total width is 10 cm, and the total height is 8 cm. The overlapping rectangle has a width of 4 cm and a height of 4 cm which is the shaded area.]()

###
Answers:
(A) - \( 36 \mathrm{~cm}^{2} \)  

(B) - \( 24 \mathrm{~cm}^{2} \)  

(C) - \( 20 \mathrm{~cm}^{2} \)  

(D) - \( 32 \mathrm{~cm}^{2} \)  

###
Misconceptions:
(A) - Assumes the area includes the overlap twice instead of recognizing it only contributes once.

(B) - Incorrectly subtracts the area of one rectangle thinking it is outside the shaded region.

(C) - Calculates the area of the shaded section incorrectly by failing to account for dimensions properly.

(D) - nan
