Question: If angle \( m \) is \( 78^\circ \) and angle \( n \) is \( 102^\circ \), what is the size of angle \( p \) ? ![Two angles meeting to form a point. They are labelled 78 degrees and 102 degrees and p.]() 

###
Answers:
(A) - \( 180^{\circ} \) 

(B) - \( 78^{\circ} \) 

(C) - \( 102^{\circ} \) 

(D) - \( 0^{\circ} \) 

###
Misconceptions:
(A) - Believes the angles at a point must sum to 180 degrees rather than the full circle of 360 degrees 

(B) - Misunderstands the arrangement of angles around a point and assumes directly using one of the given angles 

(C) - Assumes \( p \) can be either \( m \) or \( n \) without accounting for the angle relationship 

(D) - Incorrectly believes that angles cannot exist or account for the situation in the context of a full turn
