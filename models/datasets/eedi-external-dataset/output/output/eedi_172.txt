Question: What is the first term of the sequence defined by the nth-term rule: 
\[
3n + 2
\]

###
Answers:
(A) - \( 2 \) 

(B) - \( 3 \) 

(C) - \( 5 \) 

(D) - \( 0 \) 

###
Misconceptions:
(A) - Correct answer, as it accurately represents the first term when \( n = 1 \). 

(B) - Misunderstands that the first term is represented by the coefficient of n, instead of calculating it directly.

(C) - Incorrectly adds the coefficient and constant without substituting \( n = 1 \). 

(D) - Fails to recognize that the sequence starts with \( n = 1 \) and mistakenly assumes the first term can be \( 0 \).
