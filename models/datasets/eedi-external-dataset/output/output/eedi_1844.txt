Question: Given the function \( y=(x+3)(x-2) \), where does this curve intercept the \( y \) axis?

###
Answers:
(A) - \( (0, -6) \) 

(B) - \( (0, 6) \) 

(C) - \( (0, -3) \) 

(D) - \( (0, 0) \) 

###
Misconceptions:
(A) - Miscalculates the \( y \) value by incorrectly expanding the expression. 

(B) - Confuses the \( y \) intercept with the roots of the equation.

(C) - Applies the incorrect logic that \( y \) value is determined by adding the constants. 

(D) - Fails to understand that the intercept does not equal zero in this function.
