Question: How would you describe the movement to get from the circle to the square? ![Positive coordinate grid from 0 to 5 in the x and y directions with a blue circle at (2,1) and a red square at (3,4)]() 

###
Answers:
(A) - \( 1 \) square right,
\( 3 \) squares up 

(B) - \( 3 \) squares right,
\( 2 \) squares down 

(C) - \( 1 \) square up,
\( 2 \) squares right 

(D) - \( 4 \) squares up,
\( 1 \) square left 

###
Misconceptions:
(A) - Correctly identifies one of the movements but does not account for the complete transition. 

(B) - Misunderstands the vertical drop; the square is actually above the circle and thus requires an upward movement.

(C) - Counts the x-direction movement incorrectly by not calculating the full horizontal distance needed.

(D) - Incorrectly assumes a left movement which is not necessary; all needed movements are towards the right and upward.
