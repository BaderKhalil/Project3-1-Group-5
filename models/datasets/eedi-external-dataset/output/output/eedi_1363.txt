Question: ![Two triangular prisms. Prism A has a base width of 4cm, and prism B has a base width of 12cm.]() Prism A and Prism B are similar.

What is the volume scale factor to get from Prism \( A \) to Prism \( B \) ? 

###
Answers:
(A) - \( \times 3 \) 

(B) - \( \times 6 \) 

(C) - \( \times 9 \) 

(D) - \( \times 27 \) 

###
Misconceptions:
(A) - Does not realize that the volume of similar 3D shapes is scaled by the cube of the scale factor of their corresponding lengths. 

(B) - Confuses the length scale factor with volume, failing to apply the cube correctly as the factor for volumes. 

(C) - Incorrectly uses the linear scale factor instead of the volume scale factor, leading to misunderstanding the relationship between similar shapes' dimensions and their volumes. 

(D) - nan
