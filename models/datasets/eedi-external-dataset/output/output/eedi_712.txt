Misconceptions:
(A) - Correctly applies the inverse operation but makes an arithmetic error.

(B) - Thinks the inverse of multiplication is addition.

(C) - Thinks the output should be divided by 3 but uses the wrong approach to find the input.

(D) - Thinks the input is simply halved rather than applying the correct inverse operation of multiplication.
