Question: In which region would \( 3x + 4y = 12 \) belong? ![A Venn diagram with two overlapping sets. The set on the left is 'Crosses the y-axis at (0,3)' and the set on the right is 'Has a negative gradient'. A is in only 'Crosses the y-axis at (0,3)', B is in the intersection, C is in only 'Has a negative gradient', and D is outside both sets.]() 

###
Answers:
(A) - A 

(B) - B 

(C) - C 

(D) - D 

###
Misconceptions:
(A) - Believes the constant term indicates the y-intercept directly without converting to slope-intercept form. 

(B) - nan 

(C) - Thinks a line with a positive slope can appear on the right side of the y-axis. 

(D) - Assumes the line does not intersect either axis.
