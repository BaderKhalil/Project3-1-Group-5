Question: The equation \( g = 2h^2 + 4 \) is used to find values in the table below. What is the value covered by the star? 
\begin{tabular}{|c|c|c|c|c|}
\hline\( h \) & \( 1 \) & \( 2 \) & \( 3 \) & \( 4 \) \\
\hline\( g \) & \( 6 \) & \( 12 \) & \( \color{gold}\bigstar \) & \\
\hline
\end{tabular} 

###
Answers:
(A) - \( 26 \) 

(B) - \( 24 \) 

(C) - \( 20 \) 

(D) - \( 34 \) 

###
Misconceptions:
(A) - Thinks that the formula produces a value based only on the highest power and disregards the constant term. 

(B) - Thinks that by doubling the second value, you can find the next value in a non-linear relationship.

(C) - Believes the function has a consistent additive pattern instead of applying the formula correctly.

(D) - Miscalculates by misapplying the formula, assuming it produces too high an output for larger integers.
