Question: What is the total surface area of a rectangular prism with a height of 5cm, a width of 7cm, and a length of 9cm? 

###
Answers:
(A) - \( (5 \times 7) + (5 \times 9) + (7 \times 9) \) 

(B) - \( 5 \times 7 \times 9 \) 

(C) - \( (5 \times 7) \times (5 \times 9) \times (7 \times 9) \) 

(D) - \( 2 \times [(5 \times 7) + (5 \times 9) + (7 \times 9)] \) 

###
Misconceptions:
(A) - When calculating surface area, only considers the area of one face 

(B) - Calculates the volume instead of the surface area 

(C) - Incorrectly attempts to multiply each pair of dimensions instead of adding their products 

(D) - nan
