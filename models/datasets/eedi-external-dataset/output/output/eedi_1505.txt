Question: Which of the following best describes how to construct a triangle with side length \( 5 \mathrm{~cm} \) and angles of \( 30^{\degree} \) and \( 70^{\degree} \) adjacent to that side? 

###
Answers:
(A) - - Draw a line \( 5 \mathrm{~cm} \) long
- Use a protractor at one end to measure \( 30^{\degree} \) and place a dot
- From the other end of the line, use a protractor to measure \( 70^{\degree} \), then draw a line through both dots to complete the triangle.

(B) - - Draw a line \( 5 \mathrm{~cm} \) long
- Measure \( 30^{\degree} \) at one end of the line with a protractor and mark a point
- From that point, measure \( 70^{\degree} \) in the opposite direction, then extend that angle to form a triangle.

(C) - - Draw a line \( 5 \mathrm{~cm} \) long
- Set the compass to \( 5 \mathrm{~cm} \) and draw arcs from each end to complete the triangle
- Measure \( 30^{\degree} \) from one end and \( 70^{\degree} \) from the other to ensure angles are correct.

(D) - - Draw a line \( 5 \mathrm{~cm} \) long
- Measure \( 30^{\degree} \) from one end and place a dot
- Use the protractor to measure \( 70^{\degree} \) from the same end, then draw straight lines through both dots to find where they meet, completing the triangle.

###
Misconceptions:
(A) - Places both angles at the ends of the same side instead of adjacent to the side. 

(B) - Assumes angles measured clockwise from the first angle will give the correct location of the triangleâ€™s vertex.

(C) - Incorrectly suggests using arcs instead of measuring the specific angles needed for the triangle.

(D) - Draws both angles at the same end of the line instead of placing them adjacent to the side.
