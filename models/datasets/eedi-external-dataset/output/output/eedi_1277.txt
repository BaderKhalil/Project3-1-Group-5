The cafe charges \( Â£ 15 \) for a particular type of sandwich.

What is the number of sandwiches sold? ![The graph shows the number of sandwiches on the x-axis and the amount of money in pounds on the y-axis. The graph consists of a straight line, starting at the origin (0,0) and passing through the points (5,10) and (10,20)]()
