Question: Complete the missing value. A rectangle is divided into two sections. One section has a length of \( \frac{3}{8} \), and the other section is blank. The total length of the rectangle is 1.

###
Answers:
(A) - \( 5/8 \)

(B) - \( \frac{3}{8} \)

(C) - \( 0.625 \)

(D) - \( 0.375 \)

###
Misconceptions:
(A) - Believes the missing section is found by simply adding to the section already known, without considering the total.

(B) - Thinks they can repeat the known fraction to find the missing part, not recognizing that it must complete the whole.

(C) - nan

(D) - Miscalculates the total by not recognizing that \( 0.375 \) represents part of the rectangle, not the missing value.
