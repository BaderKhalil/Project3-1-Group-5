Question: ![Graph showing the temperature of a city over a 24-hour period]() What was the change in temperature from \( 6 \) AM to \( 12 \) PM? 

###
Answers:
(A) - \( 15^\circ \) 

(B) - \( 10^\circ \) 

(C) - \( 5^\circ \) 

(D) - \( 20^\circ \) 

###
Misconceptions:
(A) - Miscalculates by failing to account for both the initial and final temperatures when determining the temperature change. 

(B) - Underestimates the change by only considering the initial temperature instead of finding the difference. 

(C) - Assumes the temperature did not vary significantly and uses an arbitrary small value for the change. 

(D) - Overestimates the change by mistakenly combining multiple temperature readings instead of finding the difference between two specific points.
