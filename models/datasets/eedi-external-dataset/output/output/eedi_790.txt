Question: ![A grid of 10 squares across and 8 squares up. A red right triangle, labelled "R", is drawn on the grid. Its corners are at points: 3 squares up from the bottom left corner of the grid; 1 square right and 3 squares up from the bottom left corner of the grid; and 1 square right and 7 squares up from the bottom left corner of the grid. Another red right triangle (identical shape and size to R), labelled "S", is also drawn on the grid. Its corners are at points: 7 squares right and 3 squares up from the bottom left corner of the grid; 7 squares right and 7 squares up from the bottom left corner of the grid; and 9 squares right and 3 squares up from the bottom left corner of the grid. A dark green vertical line, labelled "D", goes from top to bottom of the grid, 3 squares to the right of the left-hand side of the grid. A dark green vertical line, labelled "E", goes from top to bottom of the grid, 5 squares to the right of the left-hand side of the grid.]() Which is the correct line of reflection to map triangle \( \mathrm{R} \) to triangle \( \mathrm{S} \) ? 

###
Answers:
(A) - D 

(B) - E 

(C) - None of these lines are correct 

(D) - Both lines D and E 

###
Misconceptions:
(A) - Assumes a line of reflection must always be the closest to triangle \( R \) 
(B) - Thinks that the line of reflection can only be the one that is exactly halfway between the two shapes 
(C) - Believes that both triangles must entirely lie on one side of the line of reflection 
(D) - Incorrectly thinks that multiple lines can simultaneously serve as lines of reflection
