Question: A student recorded the number of books read by each of her classmates during the summer. \begin{tabular}{|c|c|c|}
\hline & Frequency & Degrees \\
\hline 0 Books & \( 5 \) & \( 45 \) \\
\hline 1-2 Books & \( 10 \) & \( 90 \) \\
\hline 3-4 Books & \( 8 \) & \( \mathrm{~F} \) \\
\hline
\end{tabular} What is the correct method to calculate F? 

###
Answers:
(A) - \( 360 - 45 - 90 \) 

(B) - \( \frac{8}{23} \times 360 \) 

(C) - \( 360 - (5 + 10) \times 90 \) 

(D) - \( \frac{360}{23} \) 

###
Misconceptions:
(A) - Correctly understands that the total degrees are reduced but miscalculates the degrees used. 

(B) - Believes to find the sectors degrees, you divide the frequency of that group by the number of students who read books. 

(C) - Misunderstands how to calculate the sector angle by incorrectly using individual frequencies in a multiplication. 

(D) - Incorrect approach, assumes a single proportion for total degrees rather than the sum of frequencies.
