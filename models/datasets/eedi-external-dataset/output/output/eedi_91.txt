Question: What is the first step we should take to solve the quadratic equation \( 2x^{2} - 4x - 6 = 0 \)?

###
Answers:
(A) - Add \( 4x \) to both sides of the equation 

(B) - Factor out the number \( 2 \) 

(C) - Rewrite the equation as \( x^{2} - 2x - 3 = 0 \) 

(D) - Subtract \( 6 \) from both sides of the equation 

###
Misconceptions:
(A) - Does not recognize that it is necessary to isolate terms on one side before factoring 

(B) - May think that factoring is always the best first step, ignoring the need to rearrange first 

(C) - Fails to identify that this step does not set the equation properly for usability in factoring 

(D) - Does not realize that subtracting the constant directly leads to the right form of the quadratic equation
