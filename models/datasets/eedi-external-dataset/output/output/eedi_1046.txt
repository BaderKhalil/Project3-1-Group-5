(B) - Believes that the value converges directly to the function's fixed point rather than calculating the next term.

(C) - Perceives that the function simplifies to a whole number without considering the effect of the fractions.

(D) - Calculates an intermediate step incorrectly or assumes simplification without actual computation.
