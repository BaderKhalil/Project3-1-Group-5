Question: What is the area of the shaded section of this composite shape made from rectangles? ![A composite shape made from two rectangles that form a "T" shape. The bottom rectangle has a width of 10cm and a height of 4cm. The vertical top rectangle has a width of 6cm and a height of 10cm. The top rectangle is shaded blue.]() 

###
Answers:
(A) - \( 40 \mathrm{~cm}^{2} \) 

(B) - \( 56 \mathrm{~cm}^{2} \) 

(C) - \( 34 \mathrm{~cm}^{2} \) 

(D) - \( 30 \mathrm{~cm}^{2} \) 

###
Misconceptions:
(A) - Calculates the area of one rectangle but fails to account for the overlapping sections, giving an incomplete area   

(B) - Incorrectly adds the areas of both rectangles instead of finding the area of the shaded section alone 

(C) - nan 

(D) - Confuses area with volume, applying the formula incorrectly to yield an inappropriate value
