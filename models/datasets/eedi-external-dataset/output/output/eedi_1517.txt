Question: Which of the following is a correct simplification of: \( 5y^3 + 3y^2 - 2y^3 + y^2 \)

###
Answers:
(A) - \( 3y^3 + 4y^2 \)

(B) - \( 5y^3 + 2y^2 \)

(C) - \( 2y^3 + 3y^2 \)

(D) - Cannot be simplified 

###
Misconceptions:
(A) - Incorrectly adds coefficients of like terms without combining them correctly. 

(B) - Fails to simplify by not combining like terms involving \( y^3 \) and \( y^2 \) appropriately.

(C) - Incorrectly assumes that all terms involving \( y \) can be simply added together, without paying attention to their degrees.

(D) - Incorrectly believes that the expression cannot be simplified when it actually can.
