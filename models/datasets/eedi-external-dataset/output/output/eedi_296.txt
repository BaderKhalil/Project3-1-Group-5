Question: Lisa is trying to simplify this expression using the properties of exponents.
\(
\frac{a^{5} \cdot a^{-3}}{a^{2}}
\)

What is the expression simplified to? \( a^{?} \) 

###
Answers:
(A) - \( a^{10} \)

(B) - \( a^{0} \)

(C) - \( a^{2} \)

(D) - \( a^{8} \)

###
Misconceptions:
(A) - Incorrectly applies the product rule and combines exponents inappropriately 

(B) - Assumes that any variable raised to a power of zero leads to zero, rather than acknowledging that anything raised to the power of zero is one 

(C) - nan 

(D) - Miscalculates the subtraction of exponents in the numerator or denominator
