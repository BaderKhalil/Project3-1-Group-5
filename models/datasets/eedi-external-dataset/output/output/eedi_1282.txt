###
Answers:
(A) - \( (x-3) \) 

(B) - \( (x-4) \) 

(C) - \( (x+3) \) 

(D) - \( (x-2) \) 

###

(A) - Incorrectly calculates the sum and product of terms leading to the wrong second bracket 

(B) - Misjudges the factors of the constant term not considering both signs for factors 

(C) - Mistakes the factorisation process and incorrectly adds instead of using subtraction 

(D) - nan
