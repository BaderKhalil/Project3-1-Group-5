Question: Maria is simplifying the expression involving the following brackets.

What result should she obtain when she multiplies the two terms indicated by the arrows? !(The brackets shown are (3a + 5)(2a + 4). The arrows are pointing at the 5 in the first bracket and the 2a in the second bracket.)()

###
Answers:
(A) - \( 10a \)

(B) - \( 6a^2 + 15a \)

(C) - \( 5 \cdot 2a = 10a \)

(D) - \( 12a + 5 \cdot 4 \)

###
Misconceptions:
(A) - Assumes the result is just 5 times 2 without considering the variable

(B) - Multiplies correctly, but fails to realize this represents the entire expression, not just the indicated multiplication

(C) - Only considers one multiplication and ignores the overall context of the expression

(D) - Misapplies distributive property, adding instead of multiplying the individual contributions
