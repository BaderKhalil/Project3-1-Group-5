Question: Marcus wants to find the distance between the points (2, 3) and (6, 7). He has calculated the base and height of the formed right triangle.
What is the distance? ![The image depicts points (2,3) and (6,7) connected by a straight line, with a horizontal line marked 4 and a vertical line marked 4 to form a right-angle triangle.]()

###
Answers:
(A) - \( 8 \) 

(B) - \( \sqrt{16} \) 

(C) - \( \sqrt{32} \) 

(D) - \( 4\sqrt{2} \) 

###
Misconceptions:
(A) - Does not apply the Pythagorean Theorem correctly 

(B) - Miscalculates the distance by ignoring both necessary dimensions (length and height) 

(C) - Mixes up the calculation leading to the squaring of the sides incorrectly 

(D) - Computes the multiplication of square roots incorrectly by assuming the sides are unequal
