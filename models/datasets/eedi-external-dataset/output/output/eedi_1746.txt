###
Answers:
(A) - \( (3,0) \) 

(B) - \( (1,0) \) and \( (3,0) \) 

(C) - \( (2,0) \) 

(D) - It doesn't intercept the \( x \) axis 

###
Misconceptions:
(A) - Misunderstands that the vertex of the parabola is always a solution 

(B) - Incorrectly assumes that both solutions must be real and distinct 

(C) - Incorrectly calculates using the vertex formula instead of finding the roots 

(D) - Incorrectly believes the quadratic has no real roots based on the discriminant
