Question: Which pair of numbers will help factorise \( x^{2}-8 x+15 \) ?

###
Answers:
(A) - \( 1 \times 15 \) 

(B) - \( 3 \times 5 \) 

(C) - \( 2 \times 7 \) 

(D) - \( 4 \times 4 \) 

###
Misconceptions:
(A) - Believes that when factorising a quadratic, they can use any two numbers that multiply to give the constant 

(B) - Correctly identifies the numbers that add to -8 and multiply to 15 

(C) - Believes that both numbers should be in a larger range and does not consider the addition to -8 

(D) - Assumes that for factorising a quadratic, finding two equal numbers that multiply to the constant is sufficient
