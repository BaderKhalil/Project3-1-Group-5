Question: What is the correct formula to find the area of a triangle with a base of \( b \) and a height of \( h \)?

###
Answers:
(A) - \( A = \frac{1}{2} b h \) 

(B) - \( A = b + h \) 

(C) - \( A = b \times h \) 

(D) - \( A = 2bh \) 

###
Misconceptions:
(A) - nan 

(B) - Believes area can be determined by simply adding the lengths of the base and height 

(C) - Thinks area is calculated by multiplying the base and height without considering the triangle's geometry 

(D) - Incorrectly doubles the area by using \( 2bh \) instead of finding the correct formula
