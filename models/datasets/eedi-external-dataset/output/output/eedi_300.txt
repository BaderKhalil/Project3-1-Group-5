Question: \begin{tabular}{llllll}
\( \frac{3}{5} \) & \( 0.6 \) & \( \frac{1}{2} \) & \( \frac{7}{10} \) & \( \frac{4}{5} \) & \( \frac{11}{20} \) \\
\hline
\end{tabular} Which value is the outlier in this set of data? 

###
Answers:

(B) - \( \frac{11}{20} \) 

(C) - \( 0.6 \) 

(D) - \( \frac{3}{5} \) 

###
Misconceptions:

(B) - Believes an outlier is determined by the largest numerator in the fractions, disregarding their decimal equivalents.

(C) - Believes an outlier is identifiable simply based on the decimal format, without comparing it with the others in fraction form.

(D) - nan
