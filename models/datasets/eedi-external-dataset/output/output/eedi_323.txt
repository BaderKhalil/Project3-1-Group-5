Question: Factorise \( x^{2} - 5x - 14 \)

###
Answers:
(A) - \( (x-7)(x+2) \)

(B) - \( (x+7)(x-2) \)

(C) - \( (x-1)(x-14) \)

(D) - \( (x-4)(x+3) \)

###
Misconceptions:
(A) - Believes that when factorising a quadratic, they can incorrectly apply the signs without considering the required sums and products.

(B) - Correctly identifies the factors that meet both criteria for sum and product.

(C) - Believes that when factorising a quadratic, they can simply choose numbers based on their multiplication without checking the addition.

(D) - Assumes that both factors must necessarily relate to the sum being equal to the negative coefficient of x, neglecting the constant term.
