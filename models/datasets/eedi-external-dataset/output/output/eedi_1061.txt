Question: \(2, 8, 20, 38, 62, \ldots\)

When calculating the nth-term rule of this sequence, 
what should replace the diamond?

nth-term rule: \( n^{2} \)\( \color{red}\diamond \)\( n \) \( \color{purple}\square \)

###
Answers:
(A) - \( -2 \)

(B) - \( +4 \)

(C) - \( +6 \)

(D) - \( +8 \)

###
Misconceptions:
(A) - Thinks that the constant term should decrease, confusing the overall pattern with subtraction rather than adding change. 

(B) - Believes that the linear component of the nth-term rule is always the product of the first term's difference. 

(C) - Incorrectly calculates the second difference and concludes that it suggests a smaller increment in the linear term. 

(D) - nan
