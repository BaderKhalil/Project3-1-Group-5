Question: Use the graph to find the solution to \( x^{2} > 9 \) ![A set of axes with the quadratic graph y=x^2 drawn on.]() 

###
Answers:
(A) - \( x < -3 \) 

(B) - \( x > 3 \) 

(C) - \( -3<x<3 \) 

(D) - \( x < -3 \) or \( x > 3 \) 

###
Misconceptions:
(A) - Only considers one side of the inequality and misses values greater than 3. 

(B) - Only accounts for positive solutions and ignores negative values. 

(C) - Misunderstands the inequality direction, suggesting values between -3 and 3 instead of outside that range. 

(D) - nan
