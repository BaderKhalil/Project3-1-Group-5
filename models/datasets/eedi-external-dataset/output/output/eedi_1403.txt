Question: A rectangular garden has an area of \( 72 \mathrm{~m}^{2} \). If the length of the garden is \( 12 \mathrm{~m} \), what is the width, \( w \), of the garden? ![A rectangle with the length labeled as 12m and the width labeled with w]()

###
Answers:
(A) - \( w=6 \mathrm{~m} \) 

(B) - \( w=9 \mathrm{~m} \) 

(C) - \( w=8 \mathrm{~m} \) 

(D) - \( w=4 \mathrm{~m} \) 

###
Misconceptions:
(A) - Assumes that the width is calculated by subtracting the length from the area 

(B) - Incorrectly calculates width by incorrectly applying the area formula 

(C) - Uses incorrect dimensions when solving for width 

(D) - Uses the correct area formula but misapplies the calculation leading to an unrealistic dimension
