Question: Which of the following term-to-term rule describes this sequence?
\[
3, \quad 9, \quad 27, \quad 81 \ldots
\] 

###
Answers:
(A) - To get the next term you add \( 6 \) to the previous term 

(B) - To get the next term you add the previous term to itself 

(C) - To get the next term you multiply the previous term by \( 2 \) 

(D) - To get the next term you multiply the previous term by \( 3 \) 

###
Misconceptions:
(A) - Assumes a constant difference between terms instead of recognizing the multiplicative pattern 

(B) - Mistakes the rule as a simple addition rather than a multiplication 

(C) - Incorrectly applies a doubling rule, not realizing the correct multiplier is greater than \( 2 \) 

(D) - nan
