Question: If the slope of a line is \( 3 \), what is the slope of a line that is perpendicular to it? 

###
Answers:
(A) - \( -\frac{1}{3} \) 

(B) - \( \frac{1}{3} \) 

(C) - \( -3 \) 

(D) - \( \frac{3}{1} \) 

###
Misconceptions:
(A) - This is the correct negative reciprocal, but the response might suggest the student isn't confident in identifying the negative reciprocal. 

(B) - This slope is a positive number; the student may have confused the concept of manipulating signs with finding the reciprocal.

(C) - This answer contradicts the relationship between perpendicular slopes, as the student may think that negating the slope also negates the value, rather than its reciprocal.

(D) - This answer does not invert or negate the slope, reflecting a possible misunderstanding that no change in slope occurs with perpendicularity.
