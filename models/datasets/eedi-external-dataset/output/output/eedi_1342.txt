Question: A point, \( P \), has coordinates \( (3, 5) \)

The point is reflected in the line \( y = x \)

What are the new coordinates of point P? 

###
Answers:
(A) - \( (5, 3) \) 

(B) - \( (3, 5) \) 

(C) - \( (-3, 5) \) 

(D) - \( (3, -5) \) 

###
Misconceptions:
(A) - Believes that reflection over the line \( y = x \) results in switching the x and y coordinates.

(B) - Does not understand that a point on the line of reflection will stay the same when reflected.

(C) - Incorrectly believes that reflection always leads to a negative x-coordinate.

(D) - Incorrectly thinks that reflection across a line can change the sign of y-coordinate but maintain the x-coordinate.
