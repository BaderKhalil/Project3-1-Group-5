Question: ![A pair of axes: x-axis is from -4 to 3; y-axis is from -3 to 3. A triangle, labelled "Q", is formed by connecting the points (0, 0), (2, 2), and (0, 2). The point (2, 2) is marked with a red dot. Also, the following points are labelled with the following letters: E (1, 1); F (-2, -2); G (-1, -1); H (3, 3).]() Shape \( \mathrm{Q} \) is rotated \( 90^{\circ} \) counterclockwise around the origin.

Where will the red point be on the rotated shape? 

###
Answers:
(A) - E 

(B) - F 

(C) - G 

(D) - H 

###
Misconceptions:
(A) - Confuses clockwise and counterclockwise rotation 

(B) - Rotates incorrectly, thinking the point moves in the opposite direction 

(C) - Reflects the point over an axis instead of performing the required rotation 

(D) - nan
