Question: Alex and Jamie share \( £ 45 \) in the ratio \( 4\;: 1 \). Which of the following diagrams best represents this situation? 

###
Answers:
(A) - ![A bar split into 4 pink blocks and 1 blue block. All the blocks are the same size and the whole bar is labelled £45.]() 

(B) - ![A pink bar split into 4 blocks, and below it a shorter blue bar split into 1 block. All the blocks are the same size. The length of the whole bar is labelled £45.]() 

(C) - ![A pink bar split into 4 blocks with an arrow pointing to a blue block of equal size, labelled £45.]() 

(D) - ![A pink bar split into 4 blocks and a blue bar split into 1 block. The pink block length is labelled £45.]() 

###
Misconceptions:
(A) - Incorrectly represents the total amount as divided equally among all parts rather than maintaining the given ratio. 

(B) - When drawing bar diagrams for ratios, it suggests that the total is distributed across both amounts instead of a combined total. 

(C) - Incorrectly assumes that bar lengths should be equal to the total amount, without considering the specified ratio. 

(D) - When drawing bar diagrams for ratios, shows only one part being labelled as the total amount instead of the combined lengths.
