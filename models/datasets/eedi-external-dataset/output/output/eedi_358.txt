Question: Angles \( A \) and \( B \) are formed when a transversal line intersects two parallel lines. If angle \( A \) measures 70 degrees, what is the measure of angle \( B \)? ![Two parallel lines are shown with a transversal crossing them, creating angles A and B on different sides of the transversal.]()

###
Answers:
(A) - 70 degrees

(B) - 110 degrees

(C) - 180 degrees

(D) - 140 degrees

###
Misconceptions:
(A) - Confuses corresponding angles with alternate interior angles

(B) - Assumes angles on the same side of the transversal are supplementary

(C) - Misunderstands the relationship between the sum of angles on a straight line

(D) - Miscalculates supplement with exterior angles formed by the transversal
