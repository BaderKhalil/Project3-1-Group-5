Question: What is the value of \( c \) if the quadratic equation \( x^{2} - 8x + c \) can be factored into the form \( (x - p)(x - q) \) where \( p \) and \( q \) are the roots?

###
Answers:
(A) 16

(B) 8

(C) 24

(D) 14

###
Misconceptions:
(A) - Believes that the constant term in the product of the brackets is always the square of the coefficient of x. 

(B) - Incorrectly assumes that the constant equals the sum of the numbers \( p \) and \( q \), not their product. 

(C) - Misunderstands that the product of the roots \( p \) and \( q \) should yield a value that adds up to \( 8 \). 

(D) - Confuses the relationship between coefficients and root products leading to the wrong calculation.
