        Question: STEP \( 1 \)
Which of the options is a correct first step to express the following as a single fraction?
\(
\frac{2}{x+3} + \frac{4}{x-1}
\) 

        ###
        Answers:
        (A) - \( \frac{2+4}{x+3+x-1} \) 

        (B) - \( \frac{2(x-1)}{(x-1)(x+3)} + \frac{4(x+3)}{(x-1)(x+3)} \) 

        (C) - \( \frac{2(x-1) + 4(x+3)}{(x-1)(x+3)} \) 

        (D) - \( 6 + (x+3)(x-1) \) 

        ###
        Misconceptions:
        (A) - When adding fractions, adds the numerators and denominators directly instead of finding a common denominator 

        (B) - Does not understand how to distribute numerators correctly while maintaining the original fractions' equivalence 

        (C) - nan 

        (D) - Confuses the operation by not recognizing that the result is a singular fraction
