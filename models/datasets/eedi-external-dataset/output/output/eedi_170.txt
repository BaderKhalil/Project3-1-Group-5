Question: If the \( 5^{\text {th }} \) term of a sequence is \( 15 \) and the term-to-term rule is \( 3 \), what is the \( 2^{\text {nd }} \) term in this sequence?

###
Answers:
(A) \( 9 \)

(B) \( 12 \)

(C) \( 0 \)

(D) \( 6 \)

###
Misconceptions:
(A) - Misunderstands the direction of the sequence, calculating from the 5th term downward instead of upward.

(B) - Miscalculates by assuming that the subtraction must occur instead of considering the addition from the 5th term.

(C) - Mistakenly believes the terms in the sequence can be \( 0 \) based on misinterpretation of the term-to-term rule.

(D) - Incorrectly calculates by skipping steps and providing a term too far back in the sequence.
