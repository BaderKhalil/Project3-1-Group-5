Question: In a right-angled triangle, if the length of the opposite side is 5 cm and the length of the adjacent side is 12 cm, what ratio would you use to find the angle \( \phi \) opposite the 5 cm side? ![A right-angled triangle with the opposite side marked as 5cm and the adjacent side marked as 12cm. The angle opposite the 5 cm side is labelled with φ. The longest side of the triangle has no label.]() 

###
Answers:
(A) - Sin 

(B) - Cos 

(C) - Tan 

(D) - None of these 

###
Misconceptions:
(A) - Uses sin instead of tan for finding \( φ \)

(B) - Uses cos when tan is required 

(C) - nan 

(D) - Cannot identify the appropriate trigonometric ratio for right-angled triangles
