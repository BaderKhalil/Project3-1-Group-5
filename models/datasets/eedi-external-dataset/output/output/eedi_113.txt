Question: Expand and simplify:
\[
3(4x - 2) + 2(3x + 5)
\] 

###
Answers:
(A) - \( 12x + 4 \) 

(B) - \( 18x + 1 \) 

(C) - \( 18x + 10 \) 

(D) - \( 12x - 10 \) 

###
Misconceptions:
(A) - Incorrectly calculates one of the terms or misses a sign change due to addition of constant terms.

(B) - Incorrectly adds the coefficients of the \( x \) terms after expansion.

(C) - Correctly expands but fails to simplify correctly by adding constants improperly.

(D) - Misses the distribution of a negative sign on one of the terms.
