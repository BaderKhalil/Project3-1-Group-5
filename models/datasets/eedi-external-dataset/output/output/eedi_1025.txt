Question: What are the coordinates of the intersection point of the two lines represented in the graph? ![The image shows two lines, one red going through the points (0,5) and (5,0) and another blue going through (0,2.5) and (2.5,0). The lines intersect at point (2.5, 2.5).]() 

###
Answers:
(A) - \( x=5, \quad y=5 \) 

(B) - \( x=2.5, \quad y=0 \) 

(C) - \( x=2.5, \quad y=2.5 \) 

(D) - \( x=1, \quad y=2.5 \) 

###
Misconceptions:
(A) - When finding the intersection point, they mistakenly believe it is at the point where both lines reach their maximum y-values. 

(B) - When determining the intersection, they think the solutions are solely from one of the x-intercepts without considering the value of y at that point. 

(C) - nan 

(D) - When finding the intersection, they may confuse a point lying on one of the lines and related to its y-value without considering the corresponding x-value.
