Question: Simplify the following expression as a single fraction:
\(
\frac{3}{x-2} + \frac{4}{x+3}
\)

###
Answers:
(A) - \( \frac{7}{(x-2)(x+3)} \)

(B) - \( \frac{3(x+3) + 4(x-2)}{(x-2)(x+3)} \)

(C) - \( \frac{12}{(x-2)(x+3)} \)

(D) - \( \frac{7x - 6}{(x-2)(x+3)} \)

###
Misconceptions:
(A) - Thinks that addition of fractions simply adds the numerators without finding a common denominator

(B) - Correctly multiplies out the numerators but potentially miscalculates their sum

(C) - Incorrectly assumes the terms in the denominators can be ignored and just adds the numerators without addressing the denominator

(D) - Has a calculation error in the combination of terms in the numerator

###
Subject: Adding and Subtracting Algebraic Fractions
###
ConstructName: Add algebraic fractions where the denominators are linear expressions, eg (x + 5) and (x - 3), and the numerators are single terms
###
CorrectAnswer: B
