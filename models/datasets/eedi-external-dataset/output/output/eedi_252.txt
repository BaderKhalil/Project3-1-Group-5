        Question: \( y = (x+2)(x-4) \) Where does this curve intercept the \( x \) axis? 

        ###
        Answers:
        (A) - \( \begin{array}{c}(-2,0) \\ \text { and } \\ (4,0)\end{array} \) 

        (B) - \( \begin{array}{c}(2,0) \\ \text { and } \\ (-4,0)\end{array} \) 

        (C) - \( (2,4) \) 

        (D) - \( \begin{array}{c}(2,0) \\ \text { and } \\ (4,0)\end{array} \)

        Misconceptions:
        (A) - nan 

        (B) - Believes the x-coordinates can be directly obtained from the factors without considering their signs. 

        (C) - Believes the x-intercept can have arbitrary y-coordinates, mistakenly equating x and y values. 

        (D) - Believes the x-intercept is a combination of the factors and confuses the intercepts with coordinates.
