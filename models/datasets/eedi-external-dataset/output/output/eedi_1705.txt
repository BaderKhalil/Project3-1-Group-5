### 
Question: Rectangle A has been enlarged to create Rectangle B. If Rectangle A measures 4 units in length and 2 units in width and Rectangle B measures 12 units in length and 6 units in width, what is the scale factor of the enlargement? 

### 
Answers: 
(A) - \( 2 \) 

(B) - \( \frac{1}{2} \) 

(C) - \( 2.5 \) 

(D) - \( 3 \) 

### 
Misconceptions: 
(A) - Correctly identifies the enlargement scale factor as \( \frac{\text{length of B}}{\text{length of A}} \) but mistakenly thinks the ratio should be 2 instead of 3. 

(B) - Divides the length of the image by the length of the original shape incorrectly aims for a reduction scale factor rather than an enlargement. 

(C) - Incorrectly calculates the scale factor by misunderstanding the dimensions, thinking length and width ratios should be combined multiplicatively. 

(D) - Correctly identifies the enlargement scale factor but misunderstands proportions leading to choosing an incorrect value of 3 instead of the correct value of 3.
