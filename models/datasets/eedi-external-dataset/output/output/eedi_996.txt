Question: What is the measure of angle \( x \) ? ![A parallelogram with one angle measuring \( 70^{\circ} \) in the top left corner. Find the angle \( x \), which is adjacent in the bottom left corner.]()

###
Answers:
(A) - \( 70^{\circ} \) 

(B) - \( 110^{\circ} \) 

(C) - \( 180^{\circ} \) 

(D) - Not enough information 

###
Misconceptions:
(A) - Assumes adjacent angles in a parallelogram can be equal 

(B) - Misunderstands that the sum of adjacent angles is \( 180^{\circ} \) 

(C) - Incorrectly considers that angle measures can exceed \( 180^{\circ} \) in a single angle 

(D) - Does not recognize that there is sufficient information from a known angle in a parallelogram
