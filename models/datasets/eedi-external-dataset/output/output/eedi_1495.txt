Question: Sarah and John are trying to simplify the expression \( 4x + 3y - 2x + y \). Sarah thinks the answer is \( 2x + 4y \) while John believes it is \( 3x + 4y \). Who has the correct simplification?

###
Answers:
(A) - Only Sarah 

(B) - Only John 

(C) - Both Sarah and John 

(D) - Neither is correct 

###
