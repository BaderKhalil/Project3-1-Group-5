###
Answers:
(A) - \( \begin{array}{l}\text { Apple }=0.4 \\ \text { banana }=0.3\end{array} \) 

(B) - \( \begin{array}{l}\text { Apple }=50 p, \\ \text { banana }=£ 1.00\end{array} \) 

(C) - \( \begin{array}{l}\text { Apple }=80 p \\ \text { banana }=20 p\end{array} \) 

(D) - \( \begin{array}{l}\text { Apple }=30 p \\ \text { banana }=60 p\end{array} \)

Misconceptions:
(A) - Incorrectly assumes proportionality leads to correct pricing instead of solving the systems of equations. 

(B) - Fails to consider both equations and relies on a single relationship that does not account for the whole system. 

(C) - Mistakenly identifies the costs with incorrect calculations by treating the total amounts without establishing relationships. 

(D) - nan
