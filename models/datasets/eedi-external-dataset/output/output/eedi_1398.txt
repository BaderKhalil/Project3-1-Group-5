Question: Which of the following is least likely to be the graph of a quadratic function?

###
Answers:
(A) - ![A parabolic graph opening upwards, with its vertex at the origin. It travels steeply up both sides from the vertex, creating a U shape.]()

(B) - ![A graph with two diagonal lines intersecting at the origin, creating an 'X' shape. This graph does not have a curved appearance and does not represent a parabola.]() 

(C) - ![A parabolic graph opening downwards, with its vertex above the origin. It travels steeply down both sides from the vertex, creating an upside-down U shape.]() 

(D) - ![A curved graph that starts in the bottom left, goes steeply up and to the right before flattening out, akin to a cubic function but with a slight curvature.]()

Misconceptions:
(A) - Correct understanding of a quadratic function 

(B) - Confuses linear functions for quadratic functions 

(C) - Correct understanding of a quadratic function 

(D) - Confuses cubic functions with quadratic graphs due to incorrect curvature perception
