Question: When solving these pairs of simultaneous equations, what is the best way to eliminate the \( x \) variable? Pair \( 1 \)
\(
\begin{array}{l}
4 x - 3 y = 7 \\
2 x + 3 y = 1
\end{array}
\) Pair \( 2 \)
\(
\begin{array}{l}
4 x + 3 y = 7 \\
2 x - 3 y = 1
\end{array}
\)

###
Answers:
(A) - Add Pair \( 1 \) 
Subtract Pair \( 2 \) 

(B) - Subtract Pair \( 1 \) 
Add Pair \( 2 \) 

(C) - Add Pair \( 1 \) 
Add Pair \( 2 \) 

(D) - Subtract Pair \( 1 \) 
Subtract Pair \( 2 \) 

###
Misconceptions:
(A) - Believes that subtracting equations allows for elimination regardless of the coefficients.

(B) - Assumes that adding equations with opposite coefficients leads to elimination.

(C) - Incorrectly thinks that adding both equations will always lead to successful elimination.

(D) - Believes that if the coefficients of the variable are the same, subtraction will eliminate the variable regardless of the signs.
