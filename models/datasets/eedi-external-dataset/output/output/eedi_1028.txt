Question: What is the width of the rectangle as indicated by the arrow? ![A pair of axes with no labels. 4 points are marked and joined with straight lines to make a rectangle. The top left corner of the rectangle is labelled with co-ordinate (3,8). The bottom right corner of the rectangle is labelled with co-ordinate (10,1). A double-ended horizontal arrow spans the width of the rectangle, starting level with (3,8) and ending level with the corner of the rectangle directly to the right (10,8).]()
