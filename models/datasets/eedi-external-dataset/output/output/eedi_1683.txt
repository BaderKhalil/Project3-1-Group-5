Question: This is a part of the table of values for the equation
\[
y = 2x + 1
\] ![\begin{tabular}{|l|l|}
\hline\( x \) & \(\bigstar\)  \\
\hline\( y \) & \( 5 \) \\
\hline
\end{tabular}

]() What should replace the star?

###
Answers:
(A) - \( 2 \)

(B) - \( 3 \)

(C) - \( -2 \)

(D) - \( 4 \)

###
Misconceptions:
(A) - Assumes that the answer is simply the value produced by the equation without correctly solving for \( x \).

(B) - Underestimates the effect of the slope in the equation, thinking a lower \( x \) can still yield a higher \( y \).

(C) - Incorrectly believes that a negative input for \( x \) could yield a positive \( y \) in a linear function.

(D) - nan
