Question: Which transformation correctly describes how to map rectangle A onto rectangle B? ![A coordinate grid with two rectangles drawn on it. Rectangle A has the corners at (1,1), (1,3), (4,1), and (4,3). Rectangle B has the corners at (4,1), (4,3), (7,1), and (7,3).]() 

###
Answers:
(A) - Translation 3 units to the right

(B) - Reflection in the line \( x = 5 \)

(C) - Translation 3 units to the left 

(D) - Reflection in the line \( x = 1 \)

###
Misconceptions:
(A) - Confuses direction of translation, thinking it needs to move left instead of right

(B) - Believes reflection should change the position distinctly without considering the axes involved

(C) - Makes an error in direction, miscalculating how far the shape must move

(D) - Thinks it can reflect over a line that does not genuinely bisect the distance between the two rectangles
