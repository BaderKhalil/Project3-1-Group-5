Question: The graph below shows the lines \( x + 2y = 6 \) and \( y = x - 1 \).

Which of the following points satisfies the inequalities?
\[
y > 2x - 4 \text{ and } y < \frac{1}{2}x + 3
\] ![A graph depicting two lines, one downward sloping and the other upward sloping, with relevant axes labeled. The first line intersects the y-axis at 3 and the second line intersects the y-axis at -1.]()

###
Answers:
(A) - \( (4,1) \) 

(B) - \( (3,2) \) 

(C) - \( (2,0) \) 

(D) - \( (1,5) \) 

###
Misconceptions:
(A) - Assumes both inequalities must be satisfied at the same time without checking their relationships. 

(B) - Incorrectly believes that the intersection point indicates the solutions rather than the areas defined by the inequalities.
  
(C) - Correct point, but might misinterpret the graphical representation as representing all potential solutions.

(D) - Misunderstands the shading such that any point above the line satisfies both inequalities.
