        Question: Simplify the following expression and write it as a single fraction:

\(
\frac{3}{x} \div \frac{6}{y}
\) 

        ###
        Answers:
        (A) - \( \frac{3y}{6x} \) 

        (B) - \( \frac{9}{xy} \) 

        (C) - \( \frac{2}{x} + \frac{1}{y} \) 

        (D) - \( \frac{x}{2y} \) 

        ###
        Misconceptions:
        (A) - While this is part of the simplification, it does not represent the simplest form. 

        (B) - Incorrectly multiplies the fractions instead of dividing; also misapplies the rules for combining fractions. 

        (C) - Misunderstands the division of fractions, using addition instead. 

        (D) - Confuses the operations and inversely applies them, resulting in an incorrect form.
