Question: What is the measure of angle \( q \) ? ![A triangle with angles labelled 33 degrees, 67 degrees and q [not to scale]]()

###
Answers:
(A) - \( 84^{\circ} \)

(B) - \( 45^{\circ} \)

(C) - \( 67^{\circ} \)

(D) - Not enough information

###
Misconceptions:
(A) - Miscalculates the sum of angles in a triangle by incorrectly adding the known angles 

(B) - Believes that angles can have any value and does not apply the angle sum property of triangles 

(C) - Thinks that one of the angles in the triangle can be equal to another angle, ignoring the property that angles in a triangle must sum to 180 degrees 

(D) - Does not realize that the angle sum property gives enough information to find the missing angle
