Question: Determine the final position \( (s) \) of a car when initial position \( (s_0)=10 \) meters, initial velocity \( (u)=3 \mathrm{~ms}^{-1} \), and time \( (t) \) is \( 7 \) seconds. Use the formula \( s=s_0 + ut \).

###
Answers:
(A) - \( \begin{array}{c}s=10 + 3 + 7 \\ s=20\end{array} \) 

(B) - \( \begin{array}{c}s=10 + (3 \times 7) \\ s=31\end{array} \) 

(C) - \( \begin{array}{c}s=10 + (3 + 7) \\ s=20\end{array} \) 

(D) - \( \begin{array}{c}s=10 + 3 \times 7 \\ s=31\end{array} \) 

###
Misconceptions:
(A) - Believes that all variables can simply be added without considering the correct application of the formula. 

(B) - Confuses the operation of multiplication with the addition of the initial position leading to an incorrect sum.

(C) - Thinks the addition inside the parentheses is the correct representation of the car's position instead of applying the formula correctly.

(D) - Correctly applies the formula but misunderstands the sequence of operations resulting in the right answer.
