Question: What is the slope of the line given by the equation \(2x - 4y = 8\)?

###
Answers:
(A) \( \frac{1}{2} \)

(B) \( -\frac{1}{2} \)

(C) \( 2 \)

(D) \( -2 \)

###
Misconceptions:
(A) - Incorrectly assumes that the slope is derived from the coefficients of x when not in slope-intercept form. 

(B) - Misunderstands the process of isolating y and incorrectly assumes that the negative sign reverses the slope. 

(C) - Believes that the coefficient of x directly represents the slope without taking y into account. 

(D) - Believes that once isolated, the slope from the standard form of the equation is simply the coefficients directly adjusted for the equation.
