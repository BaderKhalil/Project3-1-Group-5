Question: These two rectangles are similar (not drawn to scale). What should replace the question mark? The smaller rectangle has a width of 3cm and a height of 4cm. The larger rectangle has a width of 9cm, and the height is marked with a question mark. 

###
Answers:
(A) - \( 6 \mathrm{~cm} \) 

(B) - \( 12 \mathrm{~cm} \) 

(C) - \( 8 \mathrm{~cm} \) 

(D) - Not enough information 

###
Misconceptions:
(A) - Misunderstands the scale factor and assumes that the height is half of the width without the correct ratio 

(B) - Incorrectly doubles the corresponding height without applying the correct scale factor 

(C) - Assumes that just adding a set number keeps the shapes similar without applying proportional reasoning

(D) - Does not realize the ratio between the sides can be used to find missing dimensions
