(B) - Correct interpretation of where \( \frac{1}{6} \) lies on the scale. 

(C) - Mistakenly believes \( \frac{1}{6} \) represents a 60% chance instead of correctly identifying it as approximately 16.67%. 

(D) - Misunderstands the probability scale, thinking all values higher than \( \frac{1}{6} \) must be whole numbers.
