Question: What value should replace the question mark to solve the area of this rectangle?
Area \( = \text{length} \times \text{width} \) \( = 12 \times \) \(\color{gold}?\)
![Rectangle with length of 12cm and width of 8cm.]() 

###
Answers:
(A) - \( 8 \)

(B) - \( 96 \)

(C) - \( 4 \)

(D) - \( 20 \)

###
Misconceptions:
(A) - Correctly identifies length but assumes width is equal to the perimeter instead of focusing on dimensions for area calculation

(B) - Multiplies the dimensions incorrectly, leading to confusion between area and multiplication of dimensions

(C) - Incorrectly calculates a fraction of dimensions rather than applying the formula for area directly

(D) - Misunderstands the relationship between the dimensions and incorrectly adds instead of multiplying them for area
