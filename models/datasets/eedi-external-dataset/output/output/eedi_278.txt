Question: Which number line represents \( 2 \leq y < 5 \) ?

###
Answers:
(A) - ![A number line with a hollow circle above 5 and an arrow extending over the numbers 6, 7, 8 etc. and a filled circle above 2 with an arrow extending over the numbers 1, 0, -1 etc.]() 

(B) - ![A number line with a hollow circle above 2 connected to a filled circle above 5.]() 

(C) - ![A number line with a filled circle above 2 with an arrow extending over the numbers 3, 4, 5, 6 etc. and a hollow circle above 5 with an arrow extending over the numbers 6, 7, 8 etc.]() 

(D) - ![A number line with a filled circle above 2 connected to a hollow circle above 5.]()

Misconceptions:
(A) - Mixes up the direction of the inequalities 

(B) - Assumes the inequality allows for inclusion at the upper limit of 5 

(C) - Incorrectly suggests that the interval ends at 5, including it rather than excluding it.

(D) - Correctly shows the lower boundary but misunderstands the representation of the upper boundary by using a hollow circle.
