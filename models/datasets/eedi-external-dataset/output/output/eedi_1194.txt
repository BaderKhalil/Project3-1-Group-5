Question: Here are two points and their midpoint.
What should replace the star? ![A set of axis with points marked. A lilac circle marked and labelled by coordinates (4, -2). A red circle marked and labelled coordinates (8, 2). Another lilac circle in the second quadrant marked and labelled with brackets, x coordinate covered by a yellow star and y coordinate covered by a green triangle.]

###
Answers:
(A) - \(\color{gold}\bigstar\) = 6 

(B) - \(\color{gold}\bigstar\) = 4 

(C) - \(\color{gold}\bigstar\) = 1  

(D) - \(\color{gold}\bigstar\) = 5

Misconceptions:
(A) - Assumes the midpoint is the average of both x coordinates without considering the impact of their signs on the location.

(B) - Given two points, thinks the midpoint would always be the average of positive values without balancing the negative value.

(C) - Mistakenly calculates the x-coordinate by averaging all y-coordinates rather than the relevant x-coordinates.

(D) - Incorrectly averages the two x-coordinates leading to misplacement in terms of sign.
