Question: Maria and John are trying to solve the following pair of simultaneous equations: \( \begin{array}{l} 2x + 3y = 12 \\ 5x - y = 9 \end{array} \) Maria believes that multiplying the second equation by 3 will help eliminate \( y \). John thinks that multiplying the first equation by -1 will aid in eliminating \( y \). Who is correct?

###
Answers:
(A) - Only Maria 

(B) - Only John 

(C) - Both Maria and John 

(D) - Neither is correct 

###
Misconceptions:
(A) - Assumes that only multiplication of the second equation can lead to elimination. 

(B) - Thinks that multiplying the first equation will effectively lead to elimination when it actually complicates the situation in this scenario.

(C) - Misunderstands the elimination process and believes both methods can work when they cannot. 

(D) - Fails to identify that one correct method can be applied and thinks both methods result in failure.
