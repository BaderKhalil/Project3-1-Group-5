Question: Maria needs to solve the system of equations below.

\[
4x + 2y = 10
\]
\[
2x - y = 1
\]

She decides to multiply the second equation by 2 before subtracting it from the first equation. What will she get after performing this operation?

###
Answers:
(A) - \( 4y = 8 \) 

(B) - \( 6x + 4y = 12 \) 

(C) - \( 2x + 4y = 9 \) 

(D) - \( 2x + 4y = 8 \) 

###
Misconceptions:
(A) - Incorrectly assumes the coefficients of y should remain constant while manipulating the equations. 

(B) - Fails to recognize that multiplying the entire second equation does not simply add to the system but changes the structure.

(C) - Miscalculates the combination of terms in the subtraction process, leading to an incorrect result.

(D) - Correctly calculates the relation between variables after the operation.
