Question: Maria is solving a pair of simultaneous equations, one of which is provided below.

\(
3m + 2n = 12
\)

Maria found that \( n = 2 \). What does \( m \) equal? 

###
Answers:
(A) - \( m = 0 \)

(B) - \( m = 4 \)

(C) - \( m = 6 \)

(D) - \( m = -6 \)

###
Misconceptions:
(A) - Assumes that if \( n \) is positive, \( m \) must also be positive. 

(B) - Incorrectly assumes that all terms can be treated as independent when substituting. 

(C) - Believes that substituting \( n \) into the equation doesn't change the balance of the equation. 

(D) - Misapprehends the effect of negative values when calculating \( m \).
