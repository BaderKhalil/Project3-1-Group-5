Question: Given points \( A \) and \( C \) on a coordinate plane, with \( A(-8, -2) \) and \( C(4, 6) \), determine the coordinates of point \( B \) if \( B \) lies exactly halfway between \( A \) and \( C \).

###
Answers:
(A) - \( (-2, 2) \)

(B) - \( (-6, 2) \)

(C) - \( (-2, 4) \)

(D) - \( (-2, 2) \)

###
Misconceptions:
(A) - Incorrectly averages the x-coordinates and y-coordinates.

(B) - Fails to calculate the average correctly by subtracting instead of adding before dividing by 2.

(C) - Averages the x-coordinates but misunderstands how to average the y-coordinates.

(D) - nan
