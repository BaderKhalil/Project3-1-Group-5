(C) - \( 20^{\circ} \)

(D) - \( 100^{\circ} \)

###
Misconceptions:
(A) - Assumes the triangleâ€™s angles can sum to less than \( 180^{\circ} \)

(B) - Assumes that one angle is larger than it really is without considering the triangle's angle sum property

(C) - Fails to account for the basic triangle angle sum theorem

(D) - Assumes an incorrect calculation of the remaining angles leading to an invalid sum
