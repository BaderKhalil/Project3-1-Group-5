Question: Jamie is using a function machine to solve the following problem:

I think of a number, add 12, divide it by 3, and the result is \( 8 \).

Which of the following should replace the star? ![A function machine with 4 rectangles in a row, joined by arrows pointing from left to right. The first rectangle on the left is empty and has "input" written above it. The next 2 rectangles are empty and the final rectangle on the right has a purple star inside it and has "output" written above it.]() 

###
Answers:
(A) - \( \div 3 \) 

(B) - \( +12 \) 

(C) - \( 8 \) 

(D) - \( n \) 

###
Misconceptions:
(A) - Does not understand where to place inputs/ operations/ outputs when drawing a function machine 

(B) - Confuses the sequence of operations, thinking addition comes after division instead of before 

(C) - Misunderstands the function machine's representation, thinking the output can be an intermediate result rather than the final one 

(D) - Does not recognize that 'n' is a placeholder for the input and not an operation
