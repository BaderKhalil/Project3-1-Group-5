Question: What is the value of the missing angle if two parallel lines are cut by a transversal? The angle opposite to the missing angle measures \( 75^{\circ} \). 

###
Answers:
(A) - \( 75^{\circ} \) 

(B) - \( 105^{\circ} \) 

(C) - \( 15^{\circ} \) 

(D) - \( 165^{\circ} \) 

###
Misconceptions:
(A) - Thinks the opposite angle is equal to the angle on the same side of the transversal. 

(B) - Thinks that opposite angles do not have to equal and confused the supplementary angles with corresponding angles. 

(C) - Confuses the relationship between supplementary angles, mistakenly using subtraction incorrectly. 

(D) - Thinks that angles on a straight line sum to something other than 180 degrees.
