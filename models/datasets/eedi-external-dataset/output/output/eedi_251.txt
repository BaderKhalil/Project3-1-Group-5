Question: Which operation is necessary to eliminate the \( r \)s in the following pairs of simultaneous equations?
\begin{array}{cc}
  Pair 1 & Pair 2 \\
\( 3a + 5r = 12 \) & \( 3a + 5r = 12 \)\\
\( 9a - 2r = 20 \) & \( 9a + 2r = 20 \)
\end{array}

###
Answers:
(A) - Subtract Pair \( 1 \)
Add Pair \( 2 \) 

(B) - Add Pair \( 1 \)
Subtract Pair \( 2 \) 

(C) - Subtract Pair \( 1 \)
Subtract Pair \( 2 \) 

(D) - Add Pair \( 1 \)
Add Pair \( 2 \) 

###
Misconceptions:
(A) - Believes that if the coefficients of \( r \) in one equation are the opposite of the other, the pairs can be subtracted to eliminate \( r \).

(B) - Believes that when eliminating variables, if the signs of the terms with matching coefficients are the same, we add the equations.

(C) - Believes that regardless of the signs of the terms with matching coefficients, both pairs need to be subtracted from each other to eliminate a variable.

(D) - Thinks that simply adding the pairs will always result in variable elimination, regardless of existing coefficients.
