Question: What is the equation of this parabola? ![A quadratic curve with maximum point (2,3).]() 

###
Answers:
(A) - \( y = -(x-2)^{2} + 3 \) 

(B) - \( y = (x+2)^{2} - 3 \) 

(C) - \( y = -x^{2} + 4x - 1 \) 

(D) - \( y = -x^{2} + 3 \) 

###
Misconceptions:
(A) - nan 

(B) - Forgets to account for the negative leading coefficient affecting the vertex position 

(C) - Incorrectly calculates the vertex based on standard form, ignoring the transformation involved 

(D) - Believes the vertex is always at (0, c) regardless of the linear term
