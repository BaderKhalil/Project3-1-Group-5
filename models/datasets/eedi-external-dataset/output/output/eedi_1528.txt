Question: Simplify the following by collecting like terms.
\[
8x + 3y - 5x + 2y
\]

###
Answers:
(A) - \(3x + 5y\)

(B) - \(3x + 1y\)

(C) - \(3y + 5x\)

(D) - \(8y - 5x\)

###
Misconceptions:
(A) - nan 

(B) - Misunderstands how to combine the coefficients of like terms involving \(y\).

(C) - Incorrectly assumes that only the \(y\) terms can be combined and misapplies the operation.

(D) - Confuses the operation and signs, thinks the terms involving \(x\) and \(y\) are connected through subtraction that leads to a wrong total.
