Question: A graph displays the relationship between the temperature in degrees Celsius \( T \) and the time in hours \( t \) after sunrise. 

Which of the following represents the best estimate for the gradient of the curve at \( t = 5 \)? ![A graph with time on the x axis in hours and temperature in degrees Celsius on the y axis, showing a curve with a tangent at the point (5, 25)]() 

###
Answers:
(A) - \( 5 \)

(B) - \( 4 \)

(C) - \( 1.5 \)

(D) - \( 2.5 \)

###
Misconceptions:
(A) - Misunderstands the concept of gradient and confuses it with the value of the function at that point. 

(B) - Incorrectly assumes that the gradient can be derived through a direct ratio of values at points on the y-axis alone. 

(C) - nan 

(D) - Fails to use the correct measurement for the change in temperature relative to time, resulting in an underestimation of the slope.
