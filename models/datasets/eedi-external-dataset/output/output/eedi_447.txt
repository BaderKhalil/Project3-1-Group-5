Question: When \( r=4 \)
Which of the following pairs of statements is true?

###
Answers:
(A) - \( \begin{array}{l} \pi r^{2}=48 \\ (2\pi r)=8\end{array} \)

(B) - \( \begin{array}{l} \pi r^{2}=50.24 \\ (2\pi r)=8\end{array} \)

(C) - \( \begin{array}{l} \pi r^{2}=50.24 \\ (2\pi r)=25.13\end{array} \)

(D) - \( \begin{array}{l} \pi r^{2}=50.24 \\ (2\pi r)=16\end{array} \)

###
Misconceptions:
(A) - Incorrectly computes the value of the area by not using \(\pi\) properly and calculates perimeter incorrectly.

(B) - Uses the incorrect approximation of \(\pi\) which leads to an incorrect area calculation.

(C) - Correctly applies formulas but miscalculates the double of the circumference.

(D) - Correctly applies formulas but confuses the values leading to a wrong value for the circumference.
