Question: This is a graph of 
\(y=-2x+3\) ![A set of axes with y=-2x+3 drawn on.]() Use the graph to solve 
\(-2x+3=1\)

###
Answers:
(A) - \( x=1 \)

(B) - \( x=0 \)

(C) - \( x=1 \)

(D) - \( x=2 \)

###
Misconceptions:
(A) - Believes the solution to mx + c = a is found at the y-intercept rather than considering the entire equation.

(B) - Believes that the output of the function at x=0 gives the solution to -2x + c = a.

(C) - nan 

(D) - Believes that simply using the constant from the equation provides the correct x-value without solving for x.
