        Answers:
        (A) - \( 50 \mathrm{~m}^{2} \) 

        (B) - \( 75 \mathrm{~m}^{2} \) 

        (C) - \( 100 \mathrm{~m}^{2} \) 

        (D) - \( 25 \mathrm{~m}^{2} \) 

        ###
        Misconceptions:
        (A) - Misunderstands how to calculate the area of a rectangle versus a square 

        (B) - Fails to account for the square plot correctly when calculating the total area 

        (C) - nan 

        (D) - Does not recognize that the area pertains to a composite shape rather than just the square
