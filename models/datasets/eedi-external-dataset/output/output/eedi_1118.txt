(A) - Believes the proportions must be the same in any form, not recognizing that they must maintain the same scale factor. 

(B) - Thinks that the sum of the sides being proportional indicates similarity, when actual proportionality of side lengths must hold. 

(C) - Misunderstands that just because one set of triangles is similar does not imply the other also is. 

(D) - Recognizes both pairs do not meet the criteria of similarity for triangles.
