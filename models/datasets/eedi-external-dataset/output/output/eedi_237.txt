Question: What number should replace the square when these two brackets are expanded and simplified?

\(
(q+4)(q-4) \equiv q^{2} \color{purple}\square\) \(q\)\(\color{green}\bigtriangleup
\)

###
Answers:
(A) - \(\color{green}\bigtriangleup\) = +16 

(B) - \(\color{green}\bigtriangleup\) = +0 
(no constant term) 

(C) - \(\color{green}\bigtriangleup\) = -16 

(D) - \(\color{green}\bigtriangleup\) = +8 

###
Misconceptions:
(A) - Believes that the constant term in the expansion is simply added from both numbers in the brackets 
(B) - Assumes that the resulting expression won't have a constant term due to the specific nature of the brackets 
(C) - Incorrectly thinks that multiplying two negative numbers results in a positive product 
(D) - Fails to recognize the correct multiplication of a positive and a negative number
