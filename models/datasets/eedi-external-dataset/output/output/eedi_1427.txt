Question: Maria is trying to isolate the variable y in the equation. Here is a step from her working. She has written \(3y + 5 = 20\). What operation should replace the star to continue isolating y? ![The image shows the equation with an arrow pointing to a blank space next to it where the operation would be labelled.]

###
Answers:
(A) - \( +5 \)

(B) - \( \times 5 \)

(C) - \( -5 \)

(D) - \( \div 3 \)

###
Misconceptions:
(A) - Believes that adding 5 would help in isolating y as the next step. 

(B) - Thinks to isolate y, she needs to multiply by 5 rather than perform the inverse operation. 

(C) - Correctly identifies that subtraction might be the step needed, but misunderstands the specific operation required.

(D) - nan
