The middle rectangle has "double" written inside it and the final rectangle has "output" written above it and "24" written inside it.]() What is the input of this function machine? 

###
Answers:
(A) - \( 12 \) 

(B) - \( 48 \) 

(C) - \( 36 \) 

(D) - \( 16 \) 

###
Misconceptions:
(A) - Correctly understands that the operation is doubling, leading to the correct answer.

(B) - Mistakes the operation's output by thinking it is quadrupling rather than doubling.

(C) - Believes that the function machine involves squaring rather than doubling, so they calculate based on the wrong operation.

(D) - Confuses the input value and cannot relate it to the doubling operation correctly.
