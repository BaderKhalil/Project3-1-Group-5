Question: What is the correct solution for the following pair of simultaneous equations:
\[5x - 3y = 2\]
\[2x + 4y = 10\]

###
Answers:
(A) - \( \begin{array}{l}x=1 \\ y=1.5\end{array} \)

(B) - \( \begin{array}{l}x=2 \\ y=0\\end{array} \)

(C) - \( \begin{array}{l}x=0 \\ y=2.5\end{array} \)

(D) - \( \begin{array}{l}x=3 \\ y=-1\end{array} \)

###
Misconceptions:
(A) - nan 

(B) - When solving simultaneous equations, incorrectly assumes that one can substitute numbers that satisfy only one of the equations without considering the second. 

(C) - When solving simultaneous equations, believes they can focus only on the constants without aligning both equations to find a common solution. 

(D) - When solving simultaneous equations, believes that guessing values for \(x\) and \(y\) that work in one equation is sufficient to solve for both.
