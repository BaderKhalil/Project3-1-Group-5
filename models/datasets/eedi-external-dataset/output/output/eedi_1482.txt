Question: What is the size of angle \( x \) ? ![A diagram showing 2 intersecting lines creating 4 angles, with one angle marked as \( x \) and another angle marked as \( 55^\circ \). Two angles are not marked and need to be determined.]()

###
Answers:
(A) - \( 55^{\circ} \) 

(B) - \( 125^{\circ} \) 

(C) - \( 35^{\circ} \) 

(D) - Not enough information 

###
Misconceptions:
(A) - Assumes \( x \) is equal to one of the adjacent angles rather than recognizing the relationship. 

(B) - Believes that adjacent angles add up to 180 degrees without recognizing the role of vertically opposite angles. 

(C) - Incorrectly calculates \( x \) believing that adjacent angles are supplementary but miscalculating the relationship. 

(D) - Does not recognize that vertically opposite angles are equal and assumes more information is required.
