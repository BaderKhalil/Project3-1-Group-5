Answers:
(A) - ![A function machine which has 4 parts joined by arrows pointing from left to right. "y" is the first part, written on the left, followed by a horizontal arrow pointing to a rectangle that has "‚úï 3" written inside it, followed by a horizontal arrow pointing to a rectangle that has "- 2" written inside it, followed by a horizontal arrow pointing to "ùë•"]() 

(B) - ![A function machine which has 4 parts joined by arrows pointing from left to right. "ùë•" is the first part, written on the left, followed by a horizontal arrow pointing to a rectangle that has "+ 2" written inside it, followed by a horizontal arrow pointing to a rectangle that has "‚úï 3" written inside it, followed by a horizontal arrow pointing to "y"]() 

(C) - ![A function machine which has 4 parts joined by arrows pointing from left to right. "y" is the first part, written on the left, followed by a horizontal arrow pointing to a rectangle that has "- 2" written inside it, followed by a horizontal arrow pointing to a rectangle that has "‚úï 3" written inside it, followed by a horizontal arrow pointing to "ùë•"]() 

(D) - ![A function machine which has 4 parts joined by arrows pointing from left to right. "ùë•" is the first part, written on the left, followed by a horizontal arrow pointing to a rectangle that has "- 2" written inside it, followed by a horizontal arrow pointing to a rectangle that has "‚úï 3" written inside it, followed by a horizontal arrow pointing to "y"]()

Misconceptions:
(A) - When presenting the equation as a function machine, confuses the order of operations making it appear that the multiplication happens before the subtraction. 

(B) - Misunderstands the operation in the equation by incorrectly changing the -2 to +2, leading to the wrong sequence. 

(C) - When writing a function as a function machine misorders the input and output, treating y as input instead of x. 

(D) - nan
