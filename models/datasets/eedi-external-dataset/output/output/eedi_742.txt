Question: The following numbers are the first three terms of a geometric sequence \( \begin{array}{llll}2 & 6 & 18 & \ldots\end{array} \). Find an expression for the \( n \)th term of this sequence.

###
Answers:
(A) - \( 2 \cdot 3^{n-1} \)

(B) - \( 2 \cdot 3^{n} \)

(C) - \( 6 \cdot 3^{n-1} \)

(D) - \( 6 \cdot 3^{n} \)

###
Misconceptions:
(A) - Correctly identifies the first term and the common ratio but misplaces the exponent in the formula.

(B) - Thinks the nth term should include an extra factor due to not recognizing how indexing works.

(C) - Incorrectly uses the second term as the base instead of the first term of the sequence.

(D) - Confuses the base term and the power of n, adding an extra factor incorrectly.
