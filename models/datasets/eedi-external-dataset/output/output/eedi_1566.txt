Question: A rectangle has a length of \( l \) and a width of \( w \). If both the length and width are tripled, what will be the area of the enlarged rectangle? ![A rectangle]() 

###
Answers:
(A) - \( 3lw \)

(B) - \( 9lw \)

(C) - \( 6lw \)

(D) - \( lw + 3 \)

###
Misconceptions:
(A) - Confuses area scaling with linear scaling, assuming only length is considered 

(B) - Correct approach but miscalculates the scaling factor for area 

(C) - Misunderstands the relationship between dimensions and area 

(D) - Thinks area is additive rather than multiplicative when dimensions are increased
