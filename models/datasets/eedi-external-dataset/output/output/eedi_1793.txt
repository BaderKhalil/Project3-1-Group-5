Question: \[
5, 11, 17, 23, \ldots
\]

When calculating the nth-term rule of this sequence, what should replace the star? nth-term rule: \(\color{gold}\bigstar\)n  \(\square\) 

###
Answers:
(A) - \( 6 \) 

(B) - \( 5 \) 

(C) - \( 4 \) 

(D) - \( 5 \) 

###
Misconceptions:
(A) - Confuses the addition in the sequence with subtraction when identifying the rule.

(B) - Incorrectly assumes that the first term is used directly as the coefficient, without recognizing the correct pattern.

(C) - Misunderstands that the difference between terms is constant and applies an incorrect difference.

(D) - nan
