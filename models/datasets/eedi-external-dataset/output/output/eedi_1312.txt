Question: A box contains \( 5 \) green marbles and \( 4 \) blue marbles. John randomly selects four marbles without replacement.

What is the denominator of the final unsimplified probability that all marbles selected are green?

###
Answers:
(A) - \( 36 \)

(B) - \( 126 \)

(C) - \( 210 \)

(D) - \( 9 \)

###
Misconceptions:
(A) - Calculates the denominator by finding the total number of green marbles only, not considering the total number of marbles in the box.

(B) - Recognizes the total combinations incorrectly, perhaps adding instead of multiplying.

(C) - Recognizes the need for combinations but makes a calculation error related to the sequential nature of the selections.

(D) - Adds rather than multiplies for the combined probabilities without taking into account the changes in total marbles after each draw.
