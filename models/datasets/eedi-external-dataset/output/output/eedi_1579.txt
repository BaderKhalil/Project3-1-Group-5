Question: At what time did Jamie reach a distance of 5 km from home? ![A line graph with title "A graph to illustrate the distance Jamie travels from home during a biking trip." 
The x-axis is titled "Time" and is labelled with times from 0700 to 1200 in 1-hour increments, with the axis going half an hour beyond 1200. The y-axis is titled "Distance from home (Km)" and has a scale from 0 to 10 in steps of 1 km. The following points are plotted and joined together: (0700, 0), (0800, 1), (0900, 4), (1000, 5.5), (1100, 9), (1200, 10).]()

Answers:
(A) - \( 10:00 \)

(B) - \( 9:00 \)

(C) - \( 11:00 \)

(D) - \( 8:00 \)

###
Misconceptions:
(A) - Misunderstands how to read time on graphs, selecting a time based on a miscalculation of distance.

(B) - Incorrectly estimates the distance at that time without correctly interpreting the graph.

(C) - Misreads the connection between time and distance, thinking Jamie could reach 5 km later than he did.

(D) - Misreads the scale, focusing on the wrong data point for the distance.
