Question: A rectangle is reflected across the line \( x = 3 \). If one vertex of the rectangle is at point \( A(5, 2) \), what are the new coordinates of point \( A' \) after the reflection? 

###
Answers:
(A) - \( (1, 2) \)

(B) - \( (3, 2) \)

(C) - \( (7, 2) \)

(D) - \( (9, 2) \)

###
Misconceptions:
(A) - Misunderstands the concept of reflection; incorrectly calculates the distance from the line to the point. 

(B) - Refers to the reflected point being on the line of reflection rather than understanding the concept of mirroring past the line.

(C) - Incorrectly believes that reflecting a point means adding twice the distance from the line to the point instead of mirroring it.

(D) - Misapplies the concept of reflection, thinking that the x-coordinate should always increase without regard to actual distance from the line of reflection.
