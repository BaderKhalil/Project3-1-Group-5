Question: \(
2, 5, 10, 17, 26, \ldots
\)

When calculating the nth-term rule of this sequence, what should replace the star?

nth-term rule: \( n^{2} \)\( \color{red}\star \)  \(n\) \( \color{purple}\square \)

###
Answers:
(A) - \( +1 \)

(B) - \( +2 \) 

(C) - \( -1 \) 

(D) - \( +3 \) 

###
Misconceptions:
(A) - Misunderstands that constant addition is not needed for each term in a quadratic sequence 

(B) - Assumes that the second difference does not influence the constant addition in the nth-term rule for quadratic sequences 

(C) - Believes applying a negative sign will always yield correct results regardless of the context of the sequence 

(D) - Thinks that an arbitrary positive number can be added without considering the established pattern of increments
