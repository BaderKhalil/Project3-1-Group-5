Question: Here are two points and their midpoint.
What should replace the square? ![The image is a set of axes with two points marked. One point is (4, -2). The midpoint is (1, square), so the square is the y value of the point.]()

###
Answers:
(A) - \( \square=1 \)

(B) - \( \square=-3 \)

(C) - \( \square=2 \)

(D) - \( \square=-4 \)

###
Misconceptions:
(A) - Assumes the midpoint is simply one of the endpoint y-values rather than using the correct midpoint formula 
 
(B) - Correctly uses midpoint, but misplaces the signs of the values 

(C) - Calculates an average incorrectly by adding the y-values and not dividing by two 

(D) - Incorrectly assumes both endpoint y-values would have to sum to zero for their average
