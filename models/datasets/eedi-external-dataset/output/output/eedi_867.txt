Question: What is the value of \( x \) in the equation \( 3(x - 2) = 12 \)?

###
Answers:
(A) - \( 4 \)

(B) - \( 2 \)

(C) - \( 8 \)

(D) - \( 6 \)

###
Misconceptions:
(A) - Misunderstands the step of isolating \( x \) after distributing the 3 correctly. 

(B) - Thinks that since the left side is simplified, \( x \) must be equal to just 2.

(C) - Incorrectly calculates the addition after distributing by overestimating the value of \( 12 \).

(D) - Incorrectly adds \( 2 \) to \( 12 \) instead of solving for \( x \) after distributing.
