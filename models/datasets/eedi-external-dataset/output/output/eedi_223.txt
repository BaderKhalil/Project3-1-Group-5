Question: Here is a function machine  
\( input \Rightarrow \times 4 \Rightarrow -3 \Rightarrow output \)  
The input is \( 8 \).  
Which calculation gives the correct output?  

###
Answers:  
(A) - \( 8 - 3 \times 4 \)  

(B) - \( 4(8-3) \)  

(C) - \( (8 \times 4) - 3 \)  

(D) - \( 8 \times (4 - 3) \)  

###
Misconceptions:  
(A) - Misapplies the order of operations; subtraction should not be done before multiplication in this context.  

(B) - Incorrectly assumes operations can be rearranged and misapplies the function machine process.  

(C) - Correctly follows the function machine's operations but does not correctly apply the order of operations throughout.  

(D) - Incorrectly simplifies the operation by ignoring the necessary multiplication before subtraction as described in the function machine.
