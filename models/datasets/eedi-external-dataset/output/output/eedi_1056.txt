Question: Here are the first \( 5 \) terms of a sequence \( \begin{array}{lllll}5 & 10 & 15 & 20 & 25 & \ldots\end{array} \) What position in the sequence is the number \( 50 \) ?

###
Answers:
(A) - \( 10 \)

(B) - \( 5n \)

(C) - \( 12 \)

(D) - \( 11 \)

###
Misconceptions:
(A) - Incorrectly believes that \( 50 \) corresponds directly to the formula for the term at that position without considering the sequence's structure. 

(B) - Misunderstands the nth term formula and misapplies it, thinking it gives the position directly rather than the term value.

(C) - Incorrectly assumes that the sequence position can be calculated simply by taking half of the term's value.

(D) - Correctly calculates the sequence position for \( 50 \) based on the pattern of the sequence.
