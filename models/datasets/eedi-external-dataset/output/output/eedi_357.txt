Question: How can we express the phrase:

"Subtract \( 3 \) from \( x \), then multiply by \( 2 \)"

using algebraic notation correctly? 

###
Answers:
(A) - \( 2(x - 3) \) 

(B) - \( 2x - 3 \) 

(C) - \( 2(x + 3) \) 

(D) - \( 3x - 2 \) 

###
Misconceptions:
(A) - Incorrectly assumes that \( 3 \) is subtracted from \( x \) starts the equation before multiplication occurs. 

(B) - Misunderstands the order of operations by subtracting \( 3 \) from \( 2x \) instead of from \( x \) first. 

(C) - Misinterprets the phrase by adding \( 3 \) rather than subtracting it from \( x \). 

(D) - Incorrectly mixes operations and misunderstands the phrasing by relating \( 3 \) to \( x \) in multiplication instead of subtraction.
