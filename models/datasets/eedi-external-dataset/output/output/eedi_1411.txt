Question: What is the \( 5 \) th pattern in this sequence? ![Four consecutive patterns in a sequence. The first pattern is one blue triangle. The second pattern is three blue triangles arranged in a row. The third pattern is five blue triangles forming a zigzag line, and the fourth pattern is seven blue triangles forming a more complex zigzag structure.]() 

###
Answers:
(A) - ![9 blue triangles arranged in a vertical line, forming two complete stacks of four triangles with one triangle on top.]() 

(B) - ![6 blue triangles arranged in a zigzag line with the two lowest triangles flipped upside down.]() 

(C) - ![11 blue triangles creating a complex zigzag line, with three additional triangles added to the bottom.]() 

(D) - ![10 blue triangles arranged in a more extended zigzag line than the previous patterns.]() 

###
Misconceptions:
(A) - Misinterprets the arrangement of triangles based on height rather than sequential addition. 

(B) - Incorrectly assumes the zigzag formation alters the count rather than maintaining the previous pattern's structure. 

(C) - nan 

(D) - Does not grasp the incremental increase in the number of triangles in the sequence.
