Question: \(
3(2y - 5) + 4(y + 8) \equiv C y + D
\)

What is the value of \( C \) ? 

###
Answers:
(A) - \( 10 \) 

(B) - \( 6 \) 

(C) - \( 14 \) 

(D) - \( 22 \) 

###
Misconceptions:
(A) - Incorrectly adds the coefficients of \( y \) without properly distributing the terms 

(B) - Correctly applies the distribution but miscalculates the total coefficient 

(C) - Incorrectly combines terms leading to an overestimation of the coefficient 

(D) - Fails to combine like terms correctly resulting in an exaggerated coefficient
