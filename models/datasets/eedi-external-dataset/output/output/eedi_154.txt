Question: A speed-time graph shows the motion of a car over a duration of 10 seconds. If the car reaches a speed of \( 30 \mathrm{~m/s} \) at the 5-second mark, what are the coordinates of the point where the car has a speed of \( 30 \mathrm{~m/s} \)?

### 
Answers:
(A) - \( (3,30) \) 

(B) - \( (5,30) \) 

(C) - \( (7,30) \) 

(D) - \( (10,30) \) 

###
Misconceptions:
(A) - Assumes the speed reaches \( 30 \mathrm{~m/s} \) earlier than it actually does 

(B) - nan 

(C) - Incorrectly thinks the speed continues to increase beyond \( 30 \mathrm{~m/s} \) before reaching that point 

(D) - Misinterprets the graph duration, thinking the speed is constant until the end of 10 seconds
