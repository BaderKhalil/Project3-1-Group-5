Question: Which of the following diagrams represents \( x > -2 \) ? 

###
Answers:
(A) - ![A number line with integers from -5 to 5 marked on, with x as the axis label. There is an empty circle above -2, with an arrow pointing to the left coming off it.]()

(B) - ![A number line with integers from -5 to 5 marked on, with x as the axis label. There is a filled in circle above -2, with an arrow pointing to the left coming off it.]() 

(C) - ![A number line with integers from -5 to 5 marked on, with x as the axis label. There is an empty circle above -2, with an arrow pointing to the right coming off it.]() 

(D) - ![A number line with integers from -5 to 5 marked on, with x as the axis label. There is a filled in circle above -2, with an arrow pointing to the right coming off it.]() 

###
Misconceptions:
(A) - Assumes that an empty circle indicates that the endpoint is included, which is incorrect for a greater than inequality. 

(B) - Misunderstands that a filled circle shows inclusion, leading to incorrect interpretation of the inequality. 

(C) - Correctly represents the direction of the inequality but mistakenly uses an empty circle, indicating a misunderstanding of how to denote the boundary. 

(D) - nan
