Question: Simplify the following expression: \( \frac{x^{2}-4}{x+2} \)

###
Answers:
(A) - \( x-2 \) 

(B) - \( x+2 \)

(C) - \( x^{2}-2 \)

(D) - Does not simplify

###
Misconceptions:
(A) - Thinks that the difference of squares can be simplified directly without factorization and does not realize that \( x^2 - 4 \) can be factored as \( (x-2)(x+2) \).

(B) - Incorrectly believes that you can cancel terms that are summed in the numerator and denominator, rather than identifying matching factors.

(C) - Misunderstands how to manipulate polynomials and fails to recognize that \( x^2 - 4 \) is a difference of squares that can be factorized.

(D) - nan
