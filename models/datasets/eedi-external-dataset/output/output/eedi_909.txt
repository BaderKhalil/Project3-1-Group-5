Question: Which number line represents \( 0 < x \leq 4 \) ? 

###
Answers:
(A) - ![Number line with numbers from -5 to 5. Above the 0 is a red, filled circle with an arrow to the right. Above the 4 is an open, unfilled circle with an arrow to the right.]() 

(B) - ![Number line with numbers from -5 to 5. Above the 0 is an open, unfilled circle with the arrow extending to the right. Above the 4 is a blue, filled circle with an arrow extending to the left.]() 

(C) - ![Number line with numbers from -5 to 5. Above the 0 is an open, unfilled circle and above the 4 is a green, filled circle. The two circles are joined by a horizontal line.]() 

(D) - ![Number line with numbers from -5 to 5. Above the 0 is an open, unfilled circle and above the 4 is a purple, filled circle. The two circles are joined by a horizontal line.]() 

###
Misconceptions:
(A) - Misinterprets the open and closed circles and their meanings regarding the inequality boundaries. 

(B) - Confuses which endpoint is included; the filled circle should be at 4. 

(C) - When representing an inequality on a number line, assumes that both endpoints should be open instead of recognizing the closed nature of 4. 

(D) - Nan
