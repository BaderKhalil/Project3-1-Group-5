Question: Lisa and Mark are discussing the properties of segment bisectors. 

The line \( L \) is a bisector of segment \( AB \) and passes through the midpoint \( M \) of \( AB \). 

Lisa asserts that if you know the position of line \( L \) and point \( A \), then there could be multiple positions for point \( B \). Mark disagrees and argues that knowing \( L \) and \( M \) allows us to find a unique position for \( B \). Who is correct?

###
Answers:
(A) - Only Lisa

(B) - Only Mark

(C) - Both Lisa and Mark

(D) - Neither is correct

###
Misconceptions:
(A) - Overestimates the ambiguity of finding point \( B \) given a fixed line and point \( A \).

(B) - Misunderstands the relationship between a bisector and the points it divides, assuming it leads to unique coordinates without considering the line's slope.

(C) - Misconception that one property of a line can lead to multiple valid conclusions about points on it.

(D) - Believes that neither the position of the bisector nor the midpoint can determine positions of the endpoints.
