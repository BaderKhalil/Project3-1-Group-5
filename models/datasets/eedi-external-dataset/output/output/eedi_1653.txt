Question: ![A pair of axes: x-axis is from -3 to 3; y-axis is from -3 to 3. A triangle, labelled "T", is formed by connecting the following vertices: (-1, -1), (2, -1), (0, 2), and back to (-1, -1). The point (0, 2) is marked with a blue dot. Additionally, points are plotted and labelled as follows: P (-3, -3); Q (2, 3); R (-2, 3); S (3, -2).]() Triangle \( \mathrm{T} \) is rotated \( 180^{\circ} \) through the point (0, 0).

Where will the blue point be on the rotated triangle? 

###
Answers:
(A) - R 

(B) - S 

(C) - Q 

(D) - P 

###
Misconceptions:
(A) - nan 

(B) - Moves in the wrong direction after rotation 

(C) - Confuses angles with coordinates 

(D) - Reflects instead of rotates
