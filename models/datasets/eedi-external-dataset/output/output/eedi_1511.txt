Question: A piecewise function is defined as follows:
\(
y=\left\{\begin{array}{c}
5 \text { for } 0 \leq x < 1 \\
-1 \text { for } 1 \leq x < 3 \\
3 \text { for } 3 \leq x \leq 5
\end{array}\right.
\)

What are the values of \( R \) and S? ![The graph shows three horizontal segments: from (0,5) to (1,5), then (1,-1) to (3,-1), and finally from (3,3) to (5,3).]() 

###
Answers:
(A) - \( \begin{array}{c}R=5 \\ S=1\end{array} \) 

(B) - \( \begin{array}{c}R=3 \\ S=1\end{array} \) 

(C) - \( \begin{array}{c}R=-1 \\ S=3\end{array} \) 

(D) - \( \begin{array}{c}R=3 \\ S=5\end{array} \) 

###
Misconceptions:
(A) - nan 

(B) - Fails to account for the correct range for the last segment. 

(C) - Misunderstands the value of \( R \) for the first segment. 

(D) - Confuses the values of \( R \) and \( S \) with line coordinates.
