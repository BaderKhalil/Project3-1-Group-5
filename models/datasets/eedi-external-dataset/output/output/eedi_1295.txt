Question: I have \( 150 \) apples. I give away \( 20 \% \) of them. Then, I buy \( 10 \% \) more of the remaining apples. How many apples do I have now?

###
Answers:
(A) - \( 135 \) 

(B) - \( 140 \) 

(C) - \( 150 \) 

(D) - \( 160 \) 

###
Misconceptions:
(A) - Assumes that after giving away \( 20\% \), the remaining apples account incorrectly for the additional purchase without correctly calculating the base.

(B) - Miscalculates the total remaining amount by failing to factor in the percentage added correctly from the reduced total.

(C) - Forget that giving away any apples would decrease the total, assuming never losing any from the original amount.

(D) - Incorrectly adds \( 10 \% \) of the original amount instead of the remaining apple count after the initial percentage is taken away.
