Question: This is a part of the table of values for the equation 
\[
y=3+x
\] 
\begin{tabular}{|l|l|}
\hline\( x \) & \( \bigstar \) \\
\hline\( y \) & \( 8 \) \\
\hline
\end{tabular} What should replace the star? 

###
Answers:
(A) - \( 5 \) 

(B) - \( 10 \) 

(C) - \( 3 \) 

(D) - \( 2 \) 

###
Misconceptions:
(A) - Thinks that addition with a positive yield requires matching the positive value of y with x.
(B) - Misunderstands the relationship by adding instead of rearranging the equation properly.
(C) - Assumes that the x value remains the same as y when finding corresponding values in a linear equation.
(D) - Correctly calculates the x value by rearranging the equation to \( x = y - 3 \).
