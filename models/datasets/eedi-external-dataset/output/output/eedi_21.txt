Question: Step 1: Factorise the following expression

\(
2 x^{2}+7 x+3
\) 

###
Answers:
(A) - \( (2 x+1)(x+3) \) 

(B) - \( (2 x+3)(x+1) \) 

(C) - Cannot be factorised 

(D) - \( (x+1)(2 x+3) \) 

###
Misconceptions:
(A) - Assumes that both factors must have the leading coefficient of 2 in them, leading to an incorrect distribution.

(B) - Thinks that rearranging the order of terms in the factorization can yield a correct result without verifying the product.

(C) - Misunderstands that all quadratics can be factored and dismisses it without trying.

(D) - Confuses the order of multiplication when writing factor pairs, leading to an incorrect product.
