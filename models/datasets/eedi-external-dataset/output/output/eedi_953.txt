 Question: \begin{tabular}{lclclclc|c|} \hline \(\bigstar\) & \( \;\) & 864 & \( \;\) &  \( \;\)\end{tabular} A descending linear sequence has a constant difference of \( 18 \) and the \( 2^{\text {nd }} \) term is \( 864 \).
What should replace the star? 

 ###
 Answers:
 (A) - \( 846 \) 

 (B) - \( 882 \) 

 (C) - \( 876 \) 

 (D) - \( 826 \) 

 ###
 Misconceptions:
 (A) - Thinks that the second term is the same as the first term subtracting the difference 

 (B) - Thinks you need to add the difference instead of subtracting it for a descending sequence 

 (C) - Confuses the order of terms in the sequence 

 (D) - When finding the previous term in a descending linear sequence, incorrectly reduces the difference
