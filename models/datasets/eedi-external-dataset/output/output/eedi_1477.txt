Question: Which letter describes the region where \( \boldsymbol{2x - y < 4} \) and \( \boldsymbol{y \geq 0} \) ? ![A set of axes with a diagonal line representing 2x - y = 4 and a horizontal line representing y = 0. The area of interest is to the left of the diagonal and above the horizontal line.]
A is the region above y=0 and below the line 2x - y = 4.
B is the region below both lines.
C is the region below y=0 but above 2x - y = 4.
D is the region above y=0 and below the line 2x - y = 4. ]() 

###
Answers:
(A) - A 

(B) - B 

(C) - C 

(D) - D 

###
Misconceptions:
(A) - Mixes up the regions defined by inequalities 

(B) - Confuses the shading above and below the lines 

(C) - Incorrectly interprets the inequality involving y 

(D) - Incorrectly understands the meaning of "below" for the line 2x - y = 4
