Question: Which of these quadratic equations has no real solutions?

###
Answers:
(A) - \( x^{2}-4=0 \) 

(B) - \( x^{2}+5x+6=0 \) 

(C) - \( x^{2}+4x+5=0 \) 

(D) - \( x^{2}+3x=0 \) 

###
Misconceptions:
(A) - Believes that the equation can yield real roots despite having a negative discriminant. 

(B) - Incorrectly assumes that this equation can have imaginary roots instead of realizing it has two distinct real roots.

(C) - Confuses no real solutions with one real solution, not realizing the discriminant is negative.

(D) - Misinterprets the solutions as having no real roots while they actually have two solutions at \( x = 0 \) and \( x = -3 \).
