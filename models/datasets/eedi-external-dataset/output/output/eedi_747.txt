Question: Which of the following equations represents a parabola that opens upwards and has its vertex at the point (-3, 2)? ![A Venn diagram with two overlapping sets. The set on the left is 'Opens upwards' and the set on the right is 'Vertex at (-3, 2)'. A is in only 'Opens upwards', B is in the intersection, C is in only 'Vertex at (-3, 2)' and D is outside both sets.]() 

###
Answers:
(A) \( y = (x + 3)^2 + 2 \)

(B) \( y = -(x + 3)^2 + 2 \)

(C) \( y = (x - 3)^2 + 2 \)

(D) \( y = (x + 3)^2 - 2 \)

###
Misconceptions:
(A) - nan 

(B) - Believes that a negative coefficient indicates the direction the parabola opens regardless of the vertex position 

(C) - Believes the vertex is simply based on the x-coordinate regardless of the transformation on the y-coordinate 

(D) - Believes that the vertex can be located simply by changing a sign in the equation
