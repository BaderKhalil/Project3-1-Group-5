Question: Which diagram shows an angle of \( 45^{\circ} \)?

###
Answers:
(A) - ![A 180 degree protractor (straight edge at the bottom) with 2 red lines and a blue sector marking out an acute angle. The angle is between the red line that is at 0 (inner scale) and the red line that is at 45 (inner scale) on the left of the protractor.]() 

(B) - ![A 180 degree protractor (straight edge at the bottom) with 2 red lines and a blue sector marking out an acute angle. The angle is between the red line that is at 0 (inner scale) and the red line that is at 90 (inner scale) on the right of the protractor.]() 

(C) - ![A 180 degree protractor (straight edge at the bottom) with 2 red lines and a blue sector marking out an acute angle. The angle is between the red line that is at 0 (inner scale) and the red line that is at 50 (inner scale) on the left of the protractor.]() 

(D) - ![A 180 degree protractor (straight edge at the bottom) with 2 red lines and a blue sector marking out an acute angle. The angle is between the red line that is at 0 (inner scale) and the red line that is at 45 (inner scale) on the right of the protractor.]()

Misconceptions:
(A) - Chooses the correct angle but misinterprets its location on the protractor by thinking it is measured from the wrong reference line.

(B) - Identifies an angle that is too large while misreading the protractor scale without recognizing that the angle sought is much smaller.

(C) - Misreads the angle by incorrectly estimating the measure as being closer to 50 degrees instead of 45.

(D) - nan
