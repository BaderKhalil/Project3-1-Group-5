Question: A composite shape is made of a rectangle with dimensions \( 4 \mathrm{~cm} \) by \( 2 \mathrm{~cm} \) topped by a triangle with a base of \( 4 \mathrm{~cm} \) and a height of \( 2 \mathrm{~cm} \). What is the total area of this shape?

###
Answers:
(A) - \( 10 \mathrm{~cm}^{2} \)

(B) - \( 8 \mathrm{~cm}^{2} \)

(C) - \( 6 \mathrm{~cm}^{2} \)

(D) - \( 12 \mathrm{~cm}^{2} \)

###
Misconceptions:
(A) - Misunderstands the addition of areas of different shapes, potentially miscalculating the triangle's contribution.

(B) - Correctly calculates only the rectangle's area, forgetting to account for the area of the triangle.

(C) - Miscalculates the area of the triangle, leading to an incorrect total area.

(D) - Correctly sums the calculated areas of both the rectangle and triangle.
