Question: A rectangle is dilated by a scale factor of \( 2 \), with the centre of dilation at \( (2, 1) \). What are the new coordinates of the vertex marked \( P \)? ![A coordinate grid with the x-axis going from -3 to 5 and the y-axis going from -2 to 4. Four points are plotted and joined with straight lines to form a rectangle. The points are (2,1), (2,3), (4,1), and (4,3). Point (4,1) is labelled as P. Point (2,1) is also plotted.]

###
Answers:
(A) - \( (6,1) \) 

(B) - \( (0,1) \) 

(C) - \( (8,3) \) 

(D) - \( (6,3) \) 

###
Misconceptions:
(A) - Correct enlargement is calculated 

(B) - Incorrectly interpreted the movement of the point relative to the centre of dilation 

(C) - Miscalculated the scale factor by applying it to the wrong coordinates 

(D) - Correct scale factor used but misunderstood the adjustment needed for the location of the centre of dilation
