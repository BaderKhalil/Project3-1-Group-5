        Question: A line has a gradient of \( -3 \)

A line perpendicular to this line would have a gradient of...

        ###
        Answers:
        (A) - \( 3 \)

        (B) - \( -\frac{1}{3} \)

        (C) - \( \frac{1}{3} \)

        (D) - Not enough information

        ###
        Misconceptions:
        (A) - Believes perpendicular lines have gradients that are the same but with opposite signs
        
        (B) - Believes the gradients of perpendicular lines multiply to give 1

        (C) - understands correctly that perpendicular lines have negative reciprocal gradients
        
        (D) - Does not know that the gradient can be calculated from a given gradient
