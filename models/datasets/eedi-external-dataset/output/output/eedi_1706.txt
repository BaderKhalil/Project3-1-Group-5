Question: Which of the following points lies on the circle with equation:
\(
x^{2}+y^{2}=25
\) 

###
Answers:
(A) - \( (5,0) \) 

(B) - \( (3,4) \) 

(C) - \( (-5,5) \) 

(D) - \( (0,5) \) 

###
Misconceptions:
(A) - nan 

(B) - Believes the relationship between coordinates and the radius is miscalculated 

(C) - Mixes up the distance formula with the equation of the circle 

(D) - Assumes that (0,5) could potentially equate to the radius squared when it does not
