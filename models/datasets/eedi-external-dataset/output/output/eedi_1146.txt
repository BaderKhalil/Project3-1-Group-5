Question: The area of the triangle below is \( 12 \mathrm{~cm}^{2} \).

Which of the following equations can we write from the information given? ![A triangle with a base labelled \(b\) and height labelled \(h\).]()

###
Answers:
(A) - \( \frac{1}{2}bh = 12 \)

(B) - \( b + h = 12 \)

(C) - \( 2bh = 12 \)

(D) - \( \frac{1}{2}b + h = 12 \)

###
Misconceptions:
(A) - nan 

(B) - Uses addition instead of multiplication to calculate area 

(C) - Incorrectly doubles the area formulaâ€™s factor 

(D) - Misunderstands the relationship of base and height in the area formula
