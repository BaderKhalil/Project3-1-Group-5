Question: To factorize \( x^{2}+7x+10 \), we need two numbers that: 

###
Answers:
(A) - Add to give \( 7 \) and multiply to give \( 10 \) 

(B) - Add to give \( 7x \) and multiply to give \( 10 \) 

(C) - Add to give \( 10 \) and multiply to give \( 7 \) 

(D) - Add to give \( 10x \) and multiply to give \( 7 \) 

###
Misconceptions:
(A) - nan 

(B) - When factorizing, believes the sum should include the variable \( x \) rather than just the constant term. 

(C) - Confuses the values needed for addition and multiplication when considering the terms of the quadratic expression. 

(D) - Incorrectly assumes that the coefficients should include the variables in both operations, misapplying how factorization works.
