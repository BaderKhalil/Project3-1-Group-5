Question: A triangle has angles measuring \( 45^{\circ} \) and \( 85^{\circ} \). What is the measure of the third angle? 

###
Answers:
(A) - \( 50^{\circ} \) 

(B) - \( 40^{\circ} \) 

(C) - \( 55^{\circ} \) 

(D) - \( 60^{\circ} \) 

###
Misconceptions:
(A) - Incorrectly assumes that angles can be added without considering the 180-degree total of a triangle. 

(B) - Miscalculates by subtracting from an incorrect angle sum. 

(C) - nan 

(D) - Assumes the triangle's angles could exceed the total of \( 180^{\circ} \).
