Question: Lisa has attempted to translate the blue triangle \( \left(\begin{array}{l}5 \\ 4\end{array}\right) \) ![Image showing two identical shapes on a coordinate grid. The blue shape has the point (5,4) and the corresponding point on the yellow shape is (7,8).]() What error has Lisa made?

###
Answers:
(A) - Lisa has not moved down the correct number of places 

(B) - Lisa has gone up when she should have gone down 

(C) - Lisa has not moved left the correct number of places 

(D) - Lisa has not moved right the correct number of places 

###
Misconceptions:
(A) - When describing a translation, believes moving vertically means moving down regardless of the vector's direction.

(B) - Thinks a negative y value in a column vector means to move down rather than understanding itâ€™s a matter of the translation from the initial position.

(C) - When performing a translation, confuses horizontal movement with vertical displacement.

(D) - When translating, does not account for the correct positive movement in the x-direction.
