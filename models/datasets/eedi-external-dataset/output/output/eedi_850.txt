Question: Sarah and Tim are looking at the function \( \boldsymbol{y}=\boldsymbol{3x+5} \) and are discussing possible values for \( y \) when \( x = 0 \). Sarah claims that \( y \) could be \( 5 \). Tim believes \( y \) could be \( 15 \). Who is correct?

###
Answers:
(A) - Only Sarah 

(B) - Only Tim 

(C) - Both Sarah and Tim 

(D) - Neither is correct 

###
Misconceptions:
(A) - Sarah correctly calculates \( y \) but may assume the function represents something else.

(B) - Tim misapplies the formula and gets a value above what is possible for the given \( x \).

(C) - Both incorrectly assume other possible values without validating with the equation.

(D) - The suggestion that both are wrong reflects a misunderstanding of the linear function's output.
