Question: A rectangle is reflected in the dashed vertical line. What are the new coordinates of point Q? ![A set of axes: x-axis from -2 to 6, y-axis from -2 to 4. A rectangle is plotted with vertices at (1, 1), (4, 1), (4, 3), and (1, 3). Point (1, 1) is labeled with the letter "Q". The line x=2 is shown with a purple dashed line.]()

Answers:
(A) - \( (3,1) \) 

(B) - \( (1,1) \) 

(C) - \( (0,1) \) 

(D) - \( (2,1) \) 

###
Misconceptions:
(A) - Misunderstands how to calculate new coordinates after reflection across a vertical line.  

(B) - Does not understand that a point on the line of reflection will stay the same when reflected  

(C) - Does not recognize that the x-coordinate must change symmetrically relative to the line of reflection.  

(D) - Incorrectly assumes that the point will be located directly on the line of reflection.
