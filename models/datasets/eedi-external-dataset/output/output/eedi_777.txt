Question: Which of the following steps correctly describes how to bisect an angle using a ruler and a pair of compasses? 

###
Answers:
(A) - - Draw the angle to be bisected
- Place the compass point at the vertex of the angle
- Draw an arc that intersects both rays of the angle 
- Without changing the compass width, draw arcs from each intersection point 
- Draw a straight line from the vertex to the intersection of the arcs

(B) - - Draw the angle to be bisected
- Place the compass point at one of the rays
- Draw a long arc across the angle 
- Change the compass width to the length of the arc 
- Draw an arc from the other ray to intersect the previous arc, then draw a line to the vertex

(C) - - Draw the angle to be bisected
- Place the compass point at the vertex of the angle
- Draw an arc that intersects both rays of the angle 
- Without changing the compass width, draw arcs from the intersection points to form a triangle
- Draw a straight line from the vertex to the intersection of the arcs

(D) - - Draw the angle to be bisected
- Place the compass point at the vertex of the angle
- Draw an arc that intersects both rays of the angle 
- Change the compass setting to the distance between the intersection points
- Draw a line from the vertex to the center of the intersection points

Misconceptions:
(A) - Believes that the method requires keeping the radius unchanged only after drawing the first arc.

(B) - Misunderstands that the compass must be changed to bisect the angle instead of keeping it constant, leading to incorrect constructions.

(C) - Incorrectly assumes an additional figure needs to be drawn (like a triangle) rather than just connecting the arcs.

(D) - Incorrectly thinks that measuring the distance between intersection points is necessary to draw the bisector.
