Question: A function machine is presented with three sections: the first section has "input" labeled above it and contains the expression "x + 2". The second section is empty, and the last section has "output" labeled above it with the expression "3(x + 2)" inside it. Jamie claims the function could be \( +2 \) and Alex argues it should be \( \times 3 \). Who do you agree with?

###
Answers:
(A) - Only Jamie 

(B) - Only Alex 

(C) - Both Jamie and Alex 

(D) - Neither is correct 

###
Misconceptions:
(A) - Does not understand that the operation involved is more than just addition and misinterprets the relationship between input and output. 

(B) - Misunderstands how to apply multiplication to the entire expression rather than just a part of it. 

(C) - nan 

(D) - Fails to see that the output includes both the addition and the multiplication operations needed to transform the input to output correctly.
