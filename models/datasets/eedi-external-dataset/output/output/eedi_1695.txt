Question: Sarah and Jim are analyzing rotations! ![Sarah claims that rotating a triangle 90 degrees clockwise around a point will always result in a triangle that maintains its original orientation.]() ![Jim argues that this rotation will change the triangle's orientation.]() Who do you think is correct?

###
Answers:
(A) - Only Sarah 

(B) - Only Jim 

(C) - Both Sarah and Jim 

(D) - Neither is correct 

###
Misconceptions:
(A) - Believing that any rotation does not affect the original orientation of the object. 

(B) - Assuming that a clockwise rotation does not preserve the shape or orientation when it actually does for congruent shapes. 

(C) - Thinking that both perspectives can be valid when they are actually contradictory. 

(D) - Not recognizing that rotations preserve the shape but can change the orientation of a shape in specific contexts.
