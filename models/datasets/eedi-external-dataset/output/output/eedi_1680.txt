Question: In which of the following inequalities could \( \boldsymbol{x}=-3 \) ? \begin{tabular}{ll}
Inequality \( 1 \) & Inequality \( 2 \\
-4 < x+1 & x^2 < 10
\end{tabular} 

###
Answers:
(A) - Only Inequality \( 1 \) 

(B) - Only Inequality \( 2 \) 

(C) - Both Inequalities \( 1 \) and \( 2 \) 

(D) - Neither Inequality \( 1 \) nor \( 2 \) 

###
Misconceptions:
(A) - Calculates incorrectly by failing to consider the negative value of \( x \)

(B) - Confuses the inequality sign in the context of squaring a negative number

(C) - Misunderstands the conditions under which both inequalities can hold true 

(D) - Incorrectly assumes \( -3 \) does not satisfy either inequality
