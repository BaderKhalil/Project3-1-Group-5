Question: Triangle \( A \) has sides measuring 4 cm, 5 cm, and 6 cm. If triangle \( B \) is an enlargement of triangle \( A \) by a scale factor of 2, what are the lengths of the sides of triangle \( B \)? 

###
Answers:
(A) - 8 cm, 10 cm, 12 cm 

(B) - 6 cm, 8 cm, 10 cm 

(C) - 4 cm, 5 cm, 6 cm 

(D) - 2 cm, 2.5 cm, 3 cm 

###
Misconceptions:
(A) - Correctly multiplies the side lengths but miscalculates and provides incorrect dimensions. 

(B) - Incorrectly uses the scale factor or fails to recognize it should apply to all sides uniformly. 

(C) - Doesn't apply the scale factor, providing the original dimensions instead of the enlarged ones. 

(D) - Incorrectly divides the original side lengths by the scale factor instead of multiplying.
