Question: James wants to solve the equation using the quadratic formula:
\(
x^{2}+6x+8=0
\)

What should replace the star? \( \frac{ \bigstar\pm \sqrt{?-?}}{?} \) 

###
Answers:
(A) - \( -6 \) 

(B) - \( 6 \) 

(C) - \( 8 \) 

(D) - \( -8 \) 

###
Misconceptions:
(A) - Believes that the value of b may be directly taken from \( x^2 \) instead of realizing it must correspond to the linear term. 

(B) - Misunderstands that coefficients can be positive; thinks that all values for b in the quadratic formula must be negative. 

(C) - Confuses the constant term c with the correct value for b, leading to incorrect application of the quadratic formula. 

(D) - Does not understand the standard form of the quadratic equation and struggles with distinguishing between coefficients a, b, and c.
