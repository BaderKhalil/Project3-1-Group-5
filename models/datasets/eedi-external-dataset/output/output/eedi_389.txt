Question: Consider the sequence represented as \( a_n = 3n + 1 \). What is the value of \( a_4 \)? 

### 
Answers:
(A) - \( 10 \) 

(B) - \( 12 \) 

(C) - \( 13 \) 

(D) - \( 15 \) 

### 
Misconceptions:
(A) - Incorrectly applies the formula, calculating \( a_4 \) as \( 3(3) + 1 \) instead of \( 3(4) + 1 \).

(B) - Misinterprets the formula, thinking the result should be \( 3 \times 4 \) without adding 1.

(C) - nan 

(D) - Confuses the calculation by adding an extra layer, possibly adding instead of multiplying first.
