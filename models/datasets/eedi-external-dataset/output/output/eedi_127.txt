Question: In which region would \( 2x - 3y = 6 \) belong? ![A Venn diagram with two intersecting sets. The set on the left is 'Crosses the y-axis at (-2,0)' and the set on the right is 'Has a negative gradient'. A is in the 'Crosses the y-axis at (-2,0)' set only, B is in the intersection, C is in the 'Has a negative gradient' only and D is outside both sets.]() 

###
Answers:
(A) - A 

(B) - B 

(C) - C 

(D) - D 

###
Misconceptions:
(A) - nan 

(B) - Believes that the intercept is determined solely by the value of the constant in the equation without considering its relationship to other variables. 

(C) - Misunderstands that the negative gradient applies only when both x and y are known to be positive, overlooking cases where they can be negative. 

(D) - Thinks that the line does not touch the y-axis, therefore assuming it crosses outside the defined regions.
