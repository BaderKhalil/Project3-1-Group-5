###
Answers:
(A) - \( \frac{4}{9} \)

(B) - \( \frac{4}{8} \)

(C) - \( \frac{3}{9} \)

(D) - \( \frac{3}{8} \)

Misconceptions:
(A) - nan 

(B) - Assumes the item has not been replaced in a probability question where it has actually been replaced 

(C) - Assumes the number of blue marbles decreases after the first draw 

(D) - Assumes the number of total marbles changes after the first draw when they have not been replaced
