Question: Alex and Jamie are talking about quadratic equations. Alex claims that the equation \( y = 2n^2 + 3n + 1 \) represents a linear function. Jamie argues that the equation \( y = -4n + 7 \) represents a linear function. Who is correct?

###
Answers:
(A) - Only Alex

(B) - Only Jamie

(C) - Both Alex and Jamie

(D) - Neither is correct

###
Misconceptions:
(A) - Fails to understand the distinction between linear and quadratic functions, confusing higher degree terms with linearity.

(B) - Correctly recognizes linear functions, but may overlook other forms of functions that also could be considered linear.

(C) - Misunderstands the definition of linear functions, assuming that both equations can be linear.

(D) - Incorrectly believes that all equations must fit the standard form of linear functions to be considered linear.
