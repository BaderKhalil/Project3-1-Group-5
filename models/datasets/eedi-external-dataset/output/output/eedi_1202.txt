Question: Sarah is trying to solve a pair of simultaneous equations. She has one equation written down:
\[
7 + y = 12
\]

What is the correct value of \( y \) ? 

###
Answers:
(A) - \( y=5 \) 

(B) - \( y=6 \) 

(C) - \( y=-5 \) 

(D) - \( y=-6 \) 

###
Misconceptions:
(A) - Believes that the addition of a number does not affect the value of the equation properly, leading to incorrect addition.

(B) - When isolating the variable, miscalculates the value; assumes they can simply subtract incorrectly from both sides.

(C) - Thinking a positive number can result in a negative when manipulating the equation incorrectly.

(D) - Incorrectly applies the negative sign, failing to recognize that subtracting must lead to a positive solution here.
