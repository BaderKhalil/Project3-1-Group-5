Question: Use a graphing program (e.g. Desmos) to plot the following pairs of functions.
\[
y = 2x + 1 \text{ and } y = -\frac{1}{2}x + 4
\]

Sarah claims both functions are parallel lines.

Jack believes both functions intersect at the y-axis.

Who is correct?

###
Answers:
(A) - Only Sarah 

(B) - Only Jack 

(C) - Both Sarah and Jack 

(D) - Neither is correct 

###
Misconceptions:
(A) - Confuses the slopes of the lines, assuming they are the same 

(B) - Incorrectly assumes that both lines have a y-intercept of 0 

(C) - Misunderstands the relationship between parallel lines and their slopes 

(D) - Does not know how to analyze the slopes and y-intercepts of the equations
