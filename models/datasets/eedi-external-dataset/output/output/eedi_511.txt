Question: Combine the following expression into a single fraction, simplifying your answer as much as possible: \( \frac{5x}{3y} - \frac{2y}{5x} \)

###
Answers:
(A) - \( \frac{25x^2 - 6y^2}{15xy} \)

(B) - \( \frac{3x - 10y}{15xy} \)

(C) - \( \frac{5x - 2y}{3y} \)

(D) - \( \frac{25x^2 - 6y^2}{15xy} \)

###
