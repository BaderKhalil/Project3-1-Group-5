###
Answers:
(A) - ![Pentagon]() 

(B) - ![Decagon]() 

(C) - ![Rectangle]() 

(D) - ![Triangle]() 

###
Misconceptions:
(A) - Overestimates the order of rotational symmetry for pentagons.

(B) - Underestimates the impact of more sides on order of rotational symmetry.

(C) - Confuses the properties of rectangles with those of squares, thinking they have the same order of rotational symmetry.

(D) - Misunderstands that all triangles have the same order of rotational symmetry without considering the specific type.
