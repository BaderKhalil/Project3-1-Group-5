Question: Sarah and Jake are trying to determine the measure of each interior angle in a regular hexagon.

Sarah thinks you can find it by using the formula \( \frac{(6-2) \times 180}{6} \).

Jake believes the formula should be \( \frac{540}{6} \).

Who is correct?

###
Answers:
(A) - Only Sarah

(B) - Only Jake

(C) - Both Sarah and Jake

(D) - Neither is correct

###
Misconceptions:
(A) - Misunderstands that the formula correctly accounts for the triangular nature of polygons but confuses steps in calculations.

(B) - Is correct in knowing how to divide the total interior angles but doesn't recognize the derivation of the total angle measure for a polygon.

(C) - Misinterprets that both formulas lead to the same derived answer without understanding the basis of each.

(D) - Believes neither formula leads to a valid calculation for the interior angles of a regular hexagon.
