###
Question: A line has the equation \( 2x - 4y = 8 \). What is its gradient?

###
Answers:
(A) - \( \frac{1}{2} \)

(B) - \( 2 \)

(C) - \( -2 \)

(D) - \( \frac{4}{2} \)

###
Misconceptions:
(A) - Believes that when rearranging the equation, the coefficient of \( x \) is part of the gradient.

(B) - Confuses the relationship between the coefficients and the gradient, mistakenly believing the coefficient of \( x \) represents the gradient directly.

(C) - Misunderstands that the gradient is derived from the coefficient of \( y \) being negative instead of recognizing the form.

(D) - Thinks that simplifying the fraction to obtain the gradient is an unnecessary step and just gives the numerator as the gradient.
