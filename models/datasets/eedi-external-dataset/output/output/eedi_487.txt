Question: The perimeter of this triangle is \( 12 \mathrm{~cm} \). 

What is the length of the side marked with a question mark? ![A triangle with sides measuring 4 cm, 5 cm, and a side length labelled with a question mark]() 

###
Answers:
(A) - \( 3 \mathrm{~cm} \) 

(B) - \( 4 \mathrm{~cm} \) 

(C) - \( 6 \mathrm{~cm} \) 

(D) - \( 2 \mathrm{~cm} \) 

###
Misconceptions:
(A) - Confuses the correct relationship of sides and often subtracts one of the known sides from the perimeter. 

(B) - Believes that one side can be equal to the sum of the other sides. 

(C) - Overestimates the length thinking it should be more than the total perimeter. 

(D) - Typically underestimates the side length, not considering the total perimeter appropriately.
