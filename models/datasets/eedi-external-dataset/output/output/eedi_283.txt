Question: What is the slope of the line that passes through the points (1, 2) and (3, 6)? 

###
Answers:
(A) - \( 2 \) 

(B) - \( 3 \) 

(C) - \( 4 \) 

(D) - \( 1 \) 

###
Misconceptions:
(A) - Misunderstands that the slope is calculated as rise over run and assumes incorrect values for the changes in y and x 

(B) - Correctly calculates change in y but believes change in x is larger than it is 

(C) - Overestimates the slope by miscalculating the rise over run 

(D) - Thinks the change in y and x are equal, leading to an incorrect slope of 1 

###
Subject: Gradient as change in y over change in x
###
ConstructName: Given two points, calculate the slope where the slope is a positive integer
