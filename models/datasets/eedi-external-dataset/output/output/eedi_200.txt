Question: What should replace the triangle when this expression is fully factorised? \( 4x^2 - 12x \equiv \bigstar(x - \triangle) \)

###
Answers:
(A) - \( \triangle=3 \) 

(B) - \( \triangle=4 \) 

(C) - \( \triangle=1 \) 

(D) - \( \triangle=0 \) 

###
Misconceptions:
(A) - nan

(B) - Believes that the second number in the factorisation needs to match the first coefficient instead of finding the common factor.

(C) - Misunderstands the need to factor out the greatest common factor and miscalculates.

(D) - Assumes the expression can be simplified to zero without considering the original coefficients.
