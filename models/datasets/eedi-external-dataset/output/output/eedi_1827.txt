Question: \( \begin{array}{llll}10.2, & 9.5, & 8.8, & ?\end{array} \)

What is the next term in this linear sequence? 

###
Answers:
(A) - \( 7.9 \) 

(B) - \( 8.1 \) 

(C) - \( 8.0 \) 

(D) - \( 8.2 \) 

###
Misconceptions:
(A) - Assumes the pattern continues going down further than necessary, missing the consistent decrease.

(B) - Incorrectly adds to the last term rather than recognized the sequence is strictly decreasing.

(C) - Thinks the next term must round or be a whole number without realizing it should maintain the decimal format of the sequence.

(D) - Assumes the sequence increments by a value smaller than the previous gap, misinterpreting the uniform decrease.
