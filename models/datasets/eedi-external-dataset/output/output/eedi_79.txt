Question: Using the graph of
\(
y = -x^{2} + 4x - 3
\)

What is the correct way to write the solution to
\(
y = -x^{2} + 4x - 3 \leq 0 ?
\) ![The graph is a downward-opening parabola that crosses the x-axis at the points (1,0) and (3,0) and crosses the y-axis at (0, -3).]() 

###
Answers:
(A) - \( \{x \leq 1\} \cup\{x \geq 3\} \) 

(B) - \( \{1 \leq x \leq 3\} \) 

(C) - \( \{1 \geq x \geq 3\} \) 

(D) - \( \{x \geq 1\} \cup\{x \leq 3\} \) 

###
Misconceptions:
(A) - Believes that the regions outside the roots represent the non-positive parts of the original equation. 

(B) - Assumes that the solution to a quadratic inequality is always found between the roots. 

(C) - Thinks that inequalities can be combined into one expression that represents all numbers between the two boundaries. 

(D) - Mixes up the direction of inequalities, misinterpreting which sections of the graph correspond to the desired solution.
