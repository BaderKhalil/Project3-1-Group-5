###
Answers:
(A) - \( 7.4 \times 10^{4} \) 

(B) - \( 7.4 \times 10^{3} \) 

(C) - \( 0.74 \times 10^{5} \) 

(D) - \( 4.7 \times 10^{4} \) 

###
Misconceptions:
(A) - Assumes that when adding numbers in standard form, the powers can be ignored if the number is larger. 

(B) - Misunderstands that the exponent can't be adjusted to match those of a higher power without proper conversion of the smaller number. 

(C) - Incorrectly believes that the sum can be expressed with a decimal moving in the exponential form without full addition of powers. 

(D) - Assumes that when combining the two standard forms you simply keep the larger power and add the coefficients without adjusting.
