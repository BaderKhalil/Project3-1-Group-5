Question: What is the measure of the indicated angle on the protractor? ![A protractor showing an angle between two red lines. One line is at the 120-degree mark on the outer scale, and the other line is at the 300-degree mark on the inner scale.]
() 

###
Answers:
(A) - \( 240^{\circ} \)

(B) - \( 120^{\circ} \)

(C) - \( 300^{\circ} \)

(D) - \( 60^{\circ} \)

###
Misconceptions:
(A) - Correct calculation of the angle's position, but misidentifies the degree measure from the protractor's reading. 

(B) - Incorrectly assumes the angle is measured from the 0 degree position instead of recognizing the reflex nature of the angle. 

(C) - Correct reading of the angle on the inner scale but overlooks that it's required to measure the larger angle via reflex understanding.

(D) - Mistakenly believes the angle can be a positive acute angle, misreading the protractor's position.
