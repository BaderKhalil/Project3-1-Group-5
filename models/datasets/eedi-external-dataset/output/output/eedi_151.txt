Question: Which of the following term-to-term rule describes this sequence? \( 5, \quad 8, \quad 11, \quad 14, \quad \ldots \) 

###
Answers:
(A) - To get the next term you add \( 3 \) to the previous term 

(B) - To get the next term you add \( 4 \) to the previous term 

(C) - To get the next term you subtract \( 3 \) from the previous term 

(D) - To get the next term you multiply the previous term by \( 2 \) and subtract \( 2 \) 

###
Misconceptions:
(A) - nan 

(B) - Misinterprets the incremental pattern by adding too much to each term 

(C) - Fails to recognize that the sequence is increasing, thus miscalculates the next term 

(D) - Misapplies the operation of multiplication instead of recognizing the additive pattern of the sequence
