Question: Factorise this expression, if possible:
\(
x^{2}+12x+36
\) 

###
Answers:
(A) - \( (x+6)(x+6) \) 

(B) - \( (x+3)(x+12) \) 

(C) - \( (x+4)(x+9) \) 

(D) - Does not factorise 

###
Misconceptions:
(A) - Believes that when factorising a quadratic, they need only to add the same number to both brackets regardless of the constant term. 

(B) - Confuses the relationship between coefficients in a quadratic and the numbers chosen for factorisation, leading to incorrect pairs. 

(C) - Believes that any pair of numbers that add up to b can be used to factor the quadratic, overlooking the actual product of c.

(D) - Incorrectly assumes that all quadratics can be expressed as a product of binomials without recognizing perfect squares.
