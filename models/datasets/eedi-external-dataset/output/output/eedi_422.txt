Question: Which of the following vectors describes how to get from point \( A \) to point \( B \)? ![The image shows a square grid and 2 points, A and B. Point A is 3 squares right and 5 squares down from point B.]() 

###
Answers:
(A) - \( \left(\begin{array}{l}-3 \\ 5\end{array}\right) \) 

(B) - \( \left(\begin{array}{l}-5 \\ -3\end{array}\right) \) 

(C) - \( \left(\begin{array}{c}3 \\ -5\end{array}\right) \) 

(D) - \( \left(\begin{array}{c}5 \\ 3\end{array}\right) \) 

###
Misconceptions:
(A) - Thinks that both values being negative implies moving in the opposite direction, neglecting that they should represent the correct horizontal and vertical movements. 

(B) - Misinterprets the movement direction, flipping both values incorrectly and thereby changing the intended translation direction entirely. 

(C) - nan 

(D) - Believes that positive values in a column vector indicate both rightward and upward movement, not recognizing the need for a negative value for downward movement.
