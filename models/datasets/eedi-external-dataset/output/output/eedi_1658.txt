Question: Which of the following graphs represents a direct proportionality between \( y \) and \( x \)?

###
Answers:
(A) - ![A graph with a straight line passing through the origin, sloping upwards from the bottom left to the top right.]() 

(B) - ![A graph that starts from the origin and curves upwards, showing an exponential growth pattern.]() 

(C) - ![A graph that is a horizontal line along the y-axis, indicating that \( y \) remains constant regardless of \( x \).]() 

(D) - ![A graph with a straight line passing through the origin but decreasing from the top left to the bottom right.]()
