        Question: Sarah wants to find the product of these three brackets:
\(
(x+2)(x+4)(x-1)
\)

She decides to first expand two of the brackets and sees it as:
\(
(x+2)(x+4)(x-1) = (x^2 + 6x + 8)(x - 1)
\)

Before simplifying completely, what are the terms that contain an \( \boldsymbol{x}^{2} \)?

        ###
        Answers:
        (A) - \( + x^{2} \) 

        (B) - \( \begin{array}{l}+ x^{2} \\ +6x^{2} \\ -6x^{2} \end{array} \) 

        (C) - \( \begin{array}{l}+ x^{2} \\ +6x^{2} \\ +8x^{2} \end{array} \) 

        (D) - \( \begin{array}{l}+ x^{2} \\ +6x^{2} \\ -8x^{2} \end{array} \) 

        ###
        Misconceptions:
        (A) - Only considers one \( x^2 \) term without following through all the expansions  
        
        (B) - Misinterprets coefficients, resulting in incorrect sign for the middle term  

        (C) - Does not account for a negative contribution to the final expression  

        (D) - Recognizes correct contributions but miscalculates the third \( x^2 \) term
