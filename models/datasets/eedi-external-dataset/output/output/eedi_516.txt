Question: A line has a gradient of \( -3 \) and passes through the point \( (2,5) \). The equation of this line could be...

###
Answers:
(A) - \( y=-3x+11 \)

(B) - \( y=3x-1 \)

(C) - \( y=-3x+11 \)

(D) - \( y=-3x+5 \)

###
Misconceptions:
(A) - Believes the y-intercept was calculated incorrectly by adding rather than subtracting values from the coordinate point.

(B) - Believes the sign of the gradient is irrelevant when calculating the equation of the line.

(C) - nan

(D) - Misunderstands that the y-intercept should change when moving from the point given with a negative gradient.
