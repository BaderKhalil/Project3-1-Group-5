Question: Which of the following angles is formed at vertex D in triangle ABC? ![An image of triangle ABC with point D on side AC. The angle highlighted is at vertex D.]() 

###
Answers:
(A) - \( \angle ADB \)

(B) - \( \angle DBC \)

(C) - \( \angle BDA \)

(D) - \( \angle ADC \)

###
Misconceptions:
(A) - Uses the correct format but identifies the wrong vertex for the angle.

(B) - Gives an angle notation that includes vertex D in a non-central position.

(C) - Uses the correct format, but does not include vertex D properly in the angle formation.

(D) - nan
