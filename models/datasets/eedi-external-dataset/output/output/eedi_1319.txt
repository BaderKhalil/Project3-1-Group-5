Question: Which of these expressions represents three consecutive even integers if \( n \) is a positive integer?

###
Answers:
(A) - \( n, n+2, n+4 \)

(B) - \( n, n+1, n+3 \)

(C) - \( n+2, n+4, n+6 \)

(D) - \( n, n+3, n+5 \)

###
Misconceptions:
(A) - nan 

(B) - Misunderstands what defines even integers and thinks that they can be consecutive if every other number is included.

(C) - Assumes the expression starts from \( n+2 \) which does not satisfy the requirement for the starting integer to be even.

(D) - Does not know the meaning of consecutive and includes odd integers in the sequence.
