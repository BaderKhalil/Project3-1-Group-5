Question: Aiden and Mia examined two different functions. Aiden claims that the function represented by the graph ![A graph showing a linear line sloping upwards]() is a quadratic function, while Mia suggests that the function represented by the graph ![A graph showing a linear line sloping downwards]() is a quadratic function. Who is correct?

###
Answers:
(A) - Only Aiden 

(B) - Only Mia 

(C) - Both Aiden and Mia 

(D) - Neither is correct 

###
Misconceptions:
(A) - Misidentifies linear functions as quadratic because of the slope 

(B) - Misidentifies linear functions as quadratic thinking that slopes down could be represented as a curve 

(C) - Does not understand that linear functions do not fit the definition of quadratic functions 

(D) - Recognises both are linear functions but misunderstands the requirements for a quadratic function
