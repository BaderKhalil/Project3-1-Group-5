Question: What is the vector that represents the translation which moves figure \( A \) to figure \( B \)? ![The image shows a set of axes with two triangles A and B. Triangle A has vertices at (1, 1), (2, 3), (3, 1). Triangle B has vertices at (4, 5), (5, 7), (6, 5).]()

###
Answers:
(A) - \( \left(\begin{array}{c}-3 \\ -4\end{array}\right) \)

(B) - \( \left(\begin{array}{c}3 \\ 4\end{array}\right) \)

(C) - \( \left(\begin{array}{c}3 \\ 4\end{array}\right) \)

(D) - \( \left(\begin{array}{c}-3 \\ 4\end{array}\right) \)

###
Misconceptions:
(A) - Assumes both components of the vector must be negative, overlooking the translation direction
(B) - Incorrectly believes that the alteration of coordinates only adds to the position, ignoring the entire movement vector 
(C) - Identical to option B but misreads the translation direction leading to the same incorrect answer
(D) - Confuses horizontal and vertical movements when performing the translation
