Question: In a survey about favorite fruits, the results are summarized in the following table. \begin{tabular}{|c|c|c|}
\hline Fruit & Frequency & Angle on a pie chart \\
\hline Apples  & \( \bigstar \) & \( 90 \degree \) \\
\hline Bananas & \( 6 \) & \( 120 \degree \) \\
\hline Cherries & \( 8 \) & \( 150 \degree \) \\
\hline Oranges & \(  \) & \(  \) \\
\hline TOTAL & 24 & \(  \) \\
\end{tabular} Tom wants to calculate the frequency of apples for the pie chart.

Which of the following calculations would determine what replaces the star? 

###
Answers:
(A) - \( \frac{90}{360} \times 24 \) 

(B) - \( 90 \div 24 \) 

(C) - \( \frac{360}{90} \times 6 \) 

(D) - \( 6 \div 120 \times 90 \) 

###
Misconceptions:
(A) - nan 

(B) - Thinks that frequency can be found by simply dividing the degree measure by total responses 

(C) - Does not understand that the angle is not directly related to the frequency of a different fruit using a multiplication strategy 

(D) - Assumes that frequency can be calculated from one fruit's frequency and another's pie chart angle without proper proportionality
