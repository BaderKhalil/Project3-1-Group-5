Question: Determine the nth-term rule of the sequence \( 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, \ldots \). What expression should replace the rectangle in the nth-term rule shown as ![nth-term rule:
\[
2n 
\] followed by a purple rectangle. ]() 

###
Answers:
(A) - \( +2 \) 

(B) - \( +0 \) 

(C) - \( +4 \) 

(D) - \( +1 \) 

###
Misconceptions:
(A) - Assumes the constant addition is based on the first term 

(B) - Correctly identifies the constant but overlooks the pattern of the sequence

(C) - Overestimates the pattern by considering too high of a constant

(D) - Misunderstands the increments of the sequence leading to an inaccurate adjustment
