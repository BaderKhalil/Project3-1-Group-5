Question: Jasmine wants to determine whether \( 45 \) is a term in the sequence \( 5n + 2 \).

Here is her working out. What conclusion should Jasmine draw?

 \( \begin{aligned} 5n + 2 & = 45 \\ 5n & = 43 \\ n & = \frac{43}{5} = 8.6 \end{aligned} \)

###
Answers:
(A) - \( 45 \) is not in the sequence because \( n \) is not an integer 

(B) - \( n \) cannot be a decimal in a sequence 

(C) - \( 45 \) is in the sequence at the \( 8^{\text{th}} \) position 

(D) - Jasmine made an error in her calculations 

###
Misconceptions:
(A) - Correctly identifies that \( n \) must be an integer but doesn't recognize that this means \( 45 \) is not a term 

(B) - Misunderstands that position can be a decimal or that the position must always be an integer 

(C) - Incorrectly interprets the results, assuming \( 45 \) belongs to the sequence 

(D) - Confuses the types of errors in sequence calculations and ignores the relevance of \( n \) being a decimal
