Question: Simplify the following expression by collecting like terms: \( \frac{3}{4} m^{3} + \frac{1}{2} m^{3} - \frac{5}{4} m^{3} + m^{3} \)

###
Answers:
(A) - \( 0 m^{3} \) 

(B) - \( \frac{5}{4} m^{3} \) 

(C) - \( 2 m^{3} \) 

(D) - \( \frac{1}{2} m^{3} + 2 m^{3} \) 

###
Misconceptions:
(A) - Misinterprets the total as zero without properly adding the coefficients. 

(B) - Fails to combine all terms properly and only takes the positive terms into account.

(C) - nan 

(D) - Incorrectly assumes that the sum of coefficients includes an extra variable term instead of simplifying the expression correctly.
