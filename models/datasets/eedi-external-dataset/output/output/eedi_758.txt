Question: If two parallel lines are cut by a transversal and one of the alternate interior angles is \( 65^{\circ} \), what is the measure of the angle on the opposite side of the transversal? ![Two parallel horizontal lines with a transversal. The alternate interior angle corresponding to the upper parallel line is marked '65'. ]() 

###
Answers:
(A) - \( 25^{\circ} \) 

(B) - \( 65^{\circ} \) 

(C) - \( 115^{\circ} \) 

(D) - \( 180^{\circ} \) 

###
Misconceptions:
(A) - Assumes that alternate interior angles supplement to 90 degrees 

(B) - nan 

(C) - Believes that alternate interior angles add up to 180 degrees 

(D) - Thinks all angles in a straight line must add up to 180 degrees, misapplying it to this situation
