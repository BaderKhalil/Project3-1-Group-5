Question: ![A triangle with vertices labelled A, B, and C. The side AB is labelled x + 2, the side BC is labelled 4x - 6, and the side CA is labelled 2x + 1.]() Which of the following statements is incorrect? 

###
Answers:
(A) - The perimeter \( = 7x - 3 \) 

(B) - The area can be calculated using Heron's formula. 

(C) - For triangle inequality, \( (x + 2) + (2x + 1) > (4x - 6) \) 

(D) - \( 4x - 6 < (x + 2) + (2x + 1) \) 

###
Misconceptions:
(A) - Miscalculates the sum of the sides when finding perimeter. 

(B) - Underestimates the requirements for applying Heron's formula. 

(C) - Incorrectly applies the triangle inequality theorem. 

(D) - Confuses the properties of triangle inequality with other inequalities.
