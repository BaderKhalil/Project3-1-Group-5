Question: Solve the inequality for x:
\(
x^{2} + 6x + 9 > 0
\)

###
Answers:
(A) - \( \{x \leq -3\} \)

(B) - \( \{x < -3\} \)

(C) - \( \{x > -3\} \)

(D) - \( \{x \geq -3\} \)

###
Misconceptions:
(A) - Incorrectly assumes the inequality holds for values less than or equal to the vertex of the parabola.

(B) - Fails to recognize that \( x = -3 \) is the point where the expression is equal to 0, and thus doesn't consider values greater than it.

(C) - nan

(D) - Misunderstands that a quadratic expression can be positive or zero at the vertex.
