Question: Jason and Emily are trying to solve:
\(
2x + 4 = 16
\)

Jason claims that a correct next step could be: \( 2x = 12 \)

Emily argues that a correct next step could be: \( x + 4 = 8 \)
Who is correct? 

###
Answers:
(A) - Only Jason 

(B) - Only Emily 

(C) - Both Jason and Emily 

(D) - Neither is correct 

###
Misconceptions:
(A) - Does not realize that the next step after subtracting from both sides is to isolate the variable. 

(B) - Misunderstands that to isolate x, the entire term involving x must be divided by coefficients, not just one part of it. 

(C) - Does not recognize that only specific operations should be applied to both sides of the equation to maintain equality.

(D) - Believes that the original equation can be manipulated without adhering to proper algebraic principles regarding inverse operations.
