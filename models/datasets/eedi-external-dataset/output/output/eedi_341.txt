Question: ![A grid of 6 squares across and 8 squares up. A blue vertical line runs from the bottom to the top of the grid, located 2 squares from the left edge of the grid. Next to the blue line, there is a green triangle with a base of 4 squares and a height of 3 squares. The tip of the triangle is positioned 6 squares up from the bottom of the grid, vertically aligned with the blue line where the triangle touches the line. The base of the triangle sits on a row 5 squares from the bottom. ]() Mia and Jake are discussing reflections.

Mia claims that if the triangle is reflected across the vertical line, the tip of the triangle will remain at the same position.

Jake argues that if the triangle is reflected across the vertical line, the midpoint of the base of the triangle will remain in the same position.
Who is correct? 

###
Answers:
(A) - Only Mia 

(B) - Only Jake 

(C) - Both Mia and Jake 

(D) - Neither is correct 

###
Misconceptions:
(A) - Does not understand that a point on the line of reflection remains unchanged during reflection.

(B) - Confuses the concept of midpoint with the behavior of points during reflection.

(C) - Believes that both points remain unchanged when one of them actually does change position.

(D) - Misunderstands that the midpoint of the base of the triangle is not on the line of reflection, resulting in it changing position during the reflection.
