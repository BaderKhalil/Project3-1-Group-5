###
Question: A line has the equation \( 2x - 5y = 10 \). What is its gradient?

###
Answers:
(A) - \( \frac{2}{5} \) 

(B) - \( 5 \) 

(C) - \( -\frac{2}{5} \) 

(D) - \( -5 \) 

###
Misconceptions:
(A) - Believes the gradient is found by taking the coefficient of \( x \) directly without considering its sign and relationship with \( y \).

(B) - Thinks that for a line in the form \( ax + by = c \), the coefficient of \( y \) represents the gradient.

(C) - Correctly identifies the gradient but incorrectly simplifies or retrieves the slope from the equation.

(D) - Incorrectly assumes that the gradient changes with the sign of the constant term in the equation.
