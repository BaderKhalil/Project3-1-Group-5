Question: What is the correct way to calculate the measure of the unknown angle marked [?] in the triangle?
A
\( 180 - (45 + 55) \)
B
\( 45 + 55 \)

###
Answers:
(A) - A 

(B) - B 

(C) - Both \( A \) and \( B \) 

(D) - Neither A nor B 

###
Misconceptions:
(A) - Misunderstands that angles in a triangle sum to 180 degrees and incorrectly adds the known angles instead of subtracting from 180 degrees. 

(B) - Incorrectly believes that simply adding the known angles demonstrates they are already the total angle measure. 

(C) - Incorrectly assumes both interpretations of the angles' relationships are valid when only one is correct.

(D) - Does not understand that the sum of angles in a triangle is always 180 degrees.
