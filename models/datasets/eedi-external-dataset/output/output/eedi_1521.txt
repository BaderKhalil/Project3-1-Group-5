Question: In the following shape, what value replaces the \( \color{red}\bigstar \) ? ![A diagram of a rectangle. The full height is represented as \( 2x+3 \) and there are two base segments, one labeled \( \bigstar \) and the other labeled \( x+5 \). The total base length is \( 5x + 10 \).]() 

###
Answers:
(A) - \( 3x + 5 \)

(B) - \( 5x + 7 \)

(C) - \( 7 \)

(D) - \( 2x + 2 \)

###
Misconceptions:
(A) - Confuses the addition of expressions with multiplication, incorrectly summing terms. 

(B) - Fails to correctly isolate the variable, mistakenly believes that the total value is additive rather than subtractive.

(C) - Misunderstands how variables interact, assuming a numeric result without considering the variable expressions.

(D) - Lacks knowledge on calculating composite lengths, leading to the conclusion that there is insufficient information.
