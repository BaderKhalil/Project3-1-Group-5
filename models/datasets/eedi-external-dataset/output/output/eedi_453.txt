Question: What is the next pattern in this linear sequence? ![A sequence of 4 patterns. The first pattern is a triangle made of 1 row of 1 square. The second pattern has 2 rows: the first row has 1 square, and the second row has 2 squares. The third pattern has 3 rows: the first row has 1 square, the second has 2 squares, and the third has 3 squares. The fourth pattern has 4 rows: the first row has 1 square, the second has 2 squares, the third has 3 squares, and the fourth has 4 squares.]()

Answers:
(A) - ![This pattern has 5 rows: the first row has 1 square, the second has 2 squares, the third has 3 squares, the fourth has 4 squares, and the fifth has 5 squares.]() 

(B) - ![This pattern has 6 rows: the first row has 1 square, the second has 2 squares, the third has 3 squares, the fourth has 4 squares, the fifth has 5 squares, and the sixth has 6 squares, but the squares in the last row are not aligned properly.]() 

(C) - ![This pattern has 5 rows: the first row has 1 square, the second has 3 squares, the third has 5 squares, the fourth has 7 squares, and the fifth has 9 squares.]() 

(D) - ![This pattern has 5 rows: the first row has 1 square, the second has 2 squares, the third has 3 squares, the fourth has 4 squares, and the fifth has 5 squares, but with an extra square on the bottom right.]()

Misconceptions:
(A) - Correctly identifies the row pattern but doesnâ€™t count/change the total squares correctly.

(B) - Misses the correct growth pattern and misaligns squares.

(C) - Fails to recognize the systematic increase in the number of squares per row.

(D) - Recognizes some pattern but adds unnecessary extra squares in the final row.
