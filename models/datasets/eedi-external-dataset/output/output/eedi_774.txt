Question: Which letter represents the area where \( \boldsymbol{2x - y \leq 4} \) and \( \boldsymbol{x + y \geq 2} \) ? ![Image is a graph showing the line 2x - y = 4 (dashed) and x + y = 2 (solid). The area is shaded according to the inequalities. Letter A is the area above both lines. Letter B is the area below the line 2x - y = 4. Letter C is the area below the line x + y = 2. Letter D is the area that satisfies both inequalities.]() 

###
Answers:
(A) - D 

(B) - A 

(C) - B 

(D) - C 

###
Misconceptions:
(A) - Correctly identifies the solution area 

(B) - Incorrectly assumes that the area above both lines satisfies the inequalities 

(C) - Confuses the direction of the inequalities for the first line 

(D) - Believes the area below the second line satisfies the second inequality
