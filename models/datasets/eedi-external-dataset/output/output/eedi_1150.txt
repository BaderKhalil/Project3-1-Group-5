Question: Rearrange the following equation to make \( t \) the subject
\(d = v \cdot t\)

###
Answers:
(A) - \( t = \frac{d}{v} \) 

(B) - \( t = d + v \) 

(C) - \( t = \frac{v}{d} \) 

(D) - \( t = d - v \) 

###
Misconceptions:
(A) - nan 

(B) - Misunderstands the relationship between distance, velocity, and time, thinking addition is needed instead of division. 

(C) - Confuses the formula by incorrectly rearranging terms, implying that time is the ratio of velocity to distance rather than distance to velocity. 

(D) - Misinterprets the equation by incorrectly thinking subtraction applies when isolating t.
