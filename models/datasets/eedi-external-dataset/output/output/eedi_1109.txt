        Misconceptions:
        (A) - Assumes a linear growth pattern rather than recognizing the increasing differences between terms. 

        (B) - Mistakes the pattern as one decreasing instead of increasing based on miscalculating the next interval. 

        (C) - Incorrectly identifies the correct difference but follows a misguided sequence reasoning leading to a miscalculation. 

        (D) - Misses the correct method for finding the next number by simply following the previous term rather than understanding the underlying pattern.
