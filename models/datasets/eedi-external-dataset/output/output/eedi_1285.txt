Question: The first four terms of a sequence are \( \begin{array}{llll}23 & 18 & 13 & 8 & \ldots\end{array} \) Find an expression for the nth term of this sequence.

###
Answers:
(A) - \( -5n + 28 \) 

(B) - \( -5n + 23 \) 

(C) - \( -5n \) 

(D) - \( 5n + 18 \) 

###
Misconceptions:
(A) - Assumes the initial value is incorrect and overestimates the positive term influence on the sequence.

(B) - Understands the sequence decreases but miscalculates the starting value in the nth term expression.

(C) - Incorrectly believes that the terms in a linear sequence don't consider a y-intercept value.

(D) - Confuses the relationship of terms and wrongly applies a positive coefficient for a decreasing sequence.
