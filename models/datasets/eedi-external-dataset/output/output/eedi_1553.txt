Question: In an isosceles triangle, one of the equal angles measures \( y \) degrees. If the third angle measures \( 40^\circ \), what is the value of \( y \)? ![An isosceles triangle with angles labelled y, y, and 40 degrees [not to scale]]() 

###
Answers:
(A) - \( 70^{\circ} \) 

(B) - \( 80^{\circ} \) 

(C) - \( 20^{\circ} \) 

(D) - Not enough information 

###
Misconceptions:
(A) - Forgets to account for the third angle when calculating the equal angles in an isosceles triangle. 

(B) - Incorrectly assumes that the sum of the angles does not affect the calculation of equal angles in the triangle. 

(C) - Miscalculates the angles by possibly doubling the third angle or misinterpreting the sum of angles theorem. 

(D) - nan
