Question: Which of the following statements about the systems of equations is true?
\begin{array}{ccc} 
System \( 1 \) & System \( 2 \) \\
\( x + 2y = 6 \) & & \( 3x - y = 5 \) \\
\( 2x + 4y = 12 \) & & \( 6x - 2y = 10 \)
\end{array} 

###
Answers:
(A) - Only System \( 1 \) has infinite solutions 

(B) - Only System \( 2 \) has infinite solutions 

(C) - Both System \( 1 \) and System \( 2 \) have infinite solutions 

(D) - Neither System \( 1 \) nor System \( 2 \) has infinite solutions 

###
Misconceptions:
(A) - Believes the two equations in System \( 1 \) represent different lines 

(B) - Thinks that since the equations in System \( 2 \) seem different, they must intersect at a single point 

(C) - Assumes all equations that appear similar in form must be identical 

(D) - Believes that both systems are independent and intersect at unique points
