Question: Use a graphing program (e.g., Desmos) to plot the following pairs of functions.
\[
y=2x + 3 \quad \text{ and } \quad y=-x + 1
\]

Mary claims both functions have the same slope

John claims the functions will cross the x-axis at the same point

Who is correct? 

###
Answers:
(A) - Only Mary 

(B) - Only John 

(C) - Both Mary and John 

(D) - Neither is correct 

###

(B) - Misunderstands how to find the x-intercept of a linear function 

(C) - Confuses the concept of slopes and intercepts 

(D) - Overestimates the ability of distinct linear functions to intersect at multiple common points
