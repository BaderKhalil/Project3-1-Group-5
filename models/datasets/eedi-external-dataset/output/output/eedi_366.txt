Question: In the formula for the area of a triangle, Area \( = \frac{1}{2} b h \), what value represents \( h \) when the base \( b \) is \( 10 \) cm and the triangle has a height of \( 5 \) cm? ![Triangle with base labelled 10cm and height labelled 5cm.]() 

###
Answers:
(A) - \( 10 \) 

(B) - \( 7 \) 

(C) - \( 5 \) 

(D) - \( 3 \) 

###
Misconceptions:
(A) - Uses base value as height instead of the actual height for area calculation 

(B) - Incorrectly estimates height by estimating or guessing rather than identifying the given measurement 

(C) - nan 

(D) - Uses a value that is unrelated to the triangle's dimensions as height in area formula
