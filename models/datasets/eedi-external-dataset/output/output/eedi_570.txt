Question: In the Venn diagram below, what number should be represented by \(\color{gold}\bigstar\)? ![A Venn diagram with two circles. The left hand circle is labeled 'factors of \(\star\)', the right hand circle is labeled 'factors of 24'. In the left hand circle, there is a 4 and a 6, in the overlap there is a 2, and in the right hand circle there is a 2, a 3, and a 4.]()

Misconceptions:
(A) - Believes that the number in the left circle must only share the factors that directly overlap without considering other factors.  

(B) - Believes that factors can be summed rather than multiplied to get a number in the Venn diagram.  

(C) - Believes that the overlap in the Venn diagram influences the total factors incorrectly. 

(D) - Believes that all factors in the Venn diagram must be multiplied together to find the represented number in one of the sets.
