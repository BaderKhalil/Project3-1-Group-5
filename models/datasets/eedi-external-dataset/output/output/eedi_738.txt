Question: The red shape is rotated \( 180^{\circ} \) clockwise about \( (1,5) \). Which shape gives the correct answer? ![A coordinate grid with 5 congruent shapes, one red and 4 green, which are labelled A, B, C and D. The red shape has vertices at (0,6) (0,5) (1,5) (1,4) and (0,4). Shape A has vertices at (2,4) (2,5) (3,5) (3,6) and (2,6). Shape B has vertices at (1,3) (2,3) (2,2) (1,2) and (0,3). Shape C has vertices at (2,6) (2,7) (1,7) (1,8) and (0,8). Shape D has vertices at (0,4) (1,4) (1,3) and (0,3).]()

Answers:
(A) - A 

(B) - B 

(C) - C 

(D) - D 

###
Misconceptions:
(A) - Misunderstands the effect of rotation, thinking it reflects or flips instead 

(B) - Incorrectly assumes rotating the shape changes its size or proportions 

(C) - Confuses the movement of points during rotation, misjudging the rotation angle 

(D) - nan
