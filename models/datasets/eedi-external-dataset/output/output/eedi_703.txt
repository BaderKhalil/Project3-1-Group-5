Question: In this trapezoid, if one of the base angles measures \( 75^{\circ} \), what is the measure of the other base angle? ![Trapezoid with one angle marked as 75 degrees and the other angle marked as unknown]() 

###
Answers:
(A) - \( 75^{\circ} \)

(B) - \( 105^{\circ} \)

(C) - \( 90^{\circ} \)

(D) - Not enough information to work it out

###
Misconceptions:
(A) - Thinks that both base angles in a trapezoid must be equal regardless of the type of trapezoid

(B) - Misunderstands that the angles supplementary to the base angles must add up to 180 degrees

(C) - Incorrectly believes that right angles can exist in a trapezoid without further calculation

(D) - Fails to apply the properties of trapezoids regarding angles and does not recognize specific known angles can lead to finding others
