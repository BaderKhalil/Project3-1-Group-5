Question: What should replace the star and triangle when this expression is fully factorised? \( 15x + 20 \equiv {\bigstar}(\triangle x + \bigcirc) \)

###
Answers:
(A) - \( \begin{array}{l}{\bigstar}=5 \\ \Delta=3\end{array} \)

(B) - \( \begin{array}{l}{\bigstar}=5 \\ \Delta=4\end{array} \)

(C) - \( \begin{array}{l}{\bigstar}=15 \\ \Delta=1\end{array} \)

(D) - \( \begin{array}{l}{\bigstar}=10 \\ \Delta=1\end{array} \)

###
Misconceptions:
(A) - Believes only one term can be factored out of the expression

(B) - Correctly identifies the common factor but miscalculates what remains after factorisation

(C) - Thinks the largest coefficient must always be bought out as the factor

(D) - Misunderstands that the expression can be factored further and assumes an arbitrary numeric factor
