Question: What is the simplified form of the expression:
\(
\left(3 x^{4}\right)^{2}
\)

###
Answers:
(A) - \( 9 x^{6} \)

(B) - \( 9 x^{8} \)

(C) - \( 6 x^{4} \)

(D) - \( 3 x^{8} \)

###
Misconceptions:
(A) - Thinks that when squaring a term with a coefficient, only the exponent of the variable is increased.

(B) - Incorrectly applies the exponent rule, thinking both the coefficient and the variable's exponent need to be squared incorrectly.

(C) - Misunderstands the exponent rules and thinks the product of coefficients is simply added to the variable's current exponent.

(D) - Incorrectly applies the exponent rule, forgetting to square the coefficient in addition to the variable's exponent.
