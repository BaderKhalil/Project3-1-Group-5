Question: What expression should replace the question mark in the equation? ![An equation showing 3x + 4y and ? on the left side, and 7x + 8y on the right side.]()

###
Answers:
(A) - \( 4x + 4y \)

(B) - \( 10x + 8y \)

(C) - \( 4x + 5y \)

(D) - \( 4x + 4y + 2y \)

###
Misconceptions:
(A) - Believes that only one term needs to be added to reach equivalency, neglecting the overall needed coefficient adjustments.

(B) - Incorrectly thinks that the operation involves adding the coefficients in a way that they should be added separately, rather than solving for the entire expression.

(C) - Fails to realize that terms involving ‘y’ are not being properly combined or equated.

(D) - Incorrectly adds extra terms without considering simplification or maintaining the balance of the equation.
