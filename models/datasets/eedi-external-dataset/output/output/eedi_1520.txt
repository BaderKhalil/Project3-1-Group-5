Question: What transformation maps the graph of 
\(y=2x + 5\) 
to the graph of 
\(y=-2x + 5\) 

###
Answers:
(A) - Reflection in the line
\[
y=x
\] 

(B) - Reflection in the line
\[
y=-x
\] 

(C) - Reflection in the
\[
x \text{-axis}
\] 

(D) - Reflection in the
\[
y \text{-axis}
\] 

###
Misconceptions:
(A) - Believes y=-f(x) is a reflection in y=x 

(B) - Believes y=-f(x) is a reflection in y=-x 

(C) - Believes that flipping the function vertically means reflecting in the x-axis, rather than just taking the negative of the slope. 

(D) - Believes y=-f(x) represents a reflection across the y-axis instead of the correct reflection across the x-axis.
