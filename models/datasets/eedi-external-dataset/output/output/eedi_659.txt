Question: Sarah and Mark are trying to find the area of a regular hexagon. Sarah claims it can be calculated using the formula \( \frac{3\sqrt{3}}{2} s^2 \), while Mark believes the area can be found using \( 6 \times \frac{1}{2} \times s \times h \), where \( h \) is the height. Who is correct?

###
Answers:
(A) - Only Sarah 

(B) - Only Mark 

(C) - Both Sarah and Mark 

(D) - Neither is correct 

###
Misconceptions:
(A) - Believes that Sarah's formula for the area of a regular hexagon is correct, but does not recognize the need for precise definitions of height and side lengths in the context.

(B) - Thinks Mark's formula is applicable for calculating the area of a hexagon, misunderstanding that it relies on choosing an appropriate height.

(C) - nan 

(D) - nan
