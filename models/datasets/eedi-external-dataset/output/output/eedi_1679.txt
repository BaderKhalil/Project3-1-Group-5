        Question: Last year, Mia was \( x \) years old. Her mother was \( 38 \) years old. This year, Mia is a third of her mother's age.
Which answer does not correctly represent this scenario? 

        ###
        Answers:
        (A) - \( 3(x+1)=38 \) 

        (B) - \( x+1=\frac{38+1}{3} \) 

        (C) - ![A bar model showing a bar for Mia's age as x + 1 which matches one third of her mother's bar. Her mother's bar is represented as 3 lots of x + 1, totaling 38.]() 

        (D) - ![A bar model showing a bar for Mia's age as x + 1 which is one third the width of her mother's bar. Her mother's bar is shown as 39 in total, split into 3 lots of 13.]()

        Misconceptions:
        (A) - Does not account for the increase in age from last year to this year 

        (B) - Incorrectly assumes the current age based on a wrong increase in years 

        (C) - Does not understand bar modelling in algebra 

        (D) - Does not understand bar modelling in algebra
