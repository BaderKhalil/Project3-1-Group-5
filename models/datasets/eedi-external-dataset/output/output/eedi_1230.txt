Question: In a trapezoid-shaped garden, the lengths of the parallel sides are \( 12 \mathrm{~m} \) and \( 8 \mathrm{~m} \). If the height of the garden is \( 5 \mathrm{~m} \), what is the area of the garden? 

###
Answers:
(A) - \( 40 \mathrm{~m}^2 \) 

(B) - \( 60 \mathrm{~m}^2 \) 

(C) - \( 50 \mathrm{~m}^2 \) 

(D) - \( 30 \mathrm{~m}^2 \) 

###
Misconceptions:
(A) - Misunderstands how to apply the area formula for trapezoids. 

(B) - Correctly identifies the application of the area formula. 

(C) - Miscalculates by averaging the lengths instead of using the formula. 

(D) - Fails to recognize how to calculate area with given dimensions.
