Question: STEP \( 2 \)

David is attempting to find the volume of a cylinder. He knows the radius of the base is 5cm and the height of the cylinder is \( h \) cm. Which of the following equations represents the formula to calculate the volume of the cylinder?

###
Answers:
(A) - \( V = \pi \times h \times 5^{2} \)

(B) - \( V = \pi \times 5^{2} \times h \)

(C) - \( V = 2\pi \times 5 \times h \)

(D) - \( V = \frac{1}{3} \pi \times 5^{2} \times h \)

###
Misconceptions:
(A) - Misunderstands the placement of the radius in the volume formula; it should be a multiplicative factor with height.

(B) - nan 

(C) - Confuses the formula for the volume of a cylinder with that of another shape, possibly a prism.

(D) - Incorrectly applies the formula for volume of a cone instead of a cylinder.
