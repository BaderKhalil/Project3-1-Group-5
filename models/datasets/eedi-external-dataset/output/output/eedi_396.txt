Question: James is working on the following pair of simultaneous equations:

\( \begin{aligned} 3x + 4y & = 12 \\ 2x - y & = 3 \\ \end{aligned} \)

He decides to add them together. What result will he get?

###
Answers:
(A) - \( 5x + 3y = 15 \)

(B) - \( 6x + 4y = 15 \)

(C) - \( 5x + 5y = 15 \)

(D) - \( 5x + 3y = 9 \)

###
Misconceptions:
(A) - Believes that he should only add like terms but doesn't combine the equations correctly.

(B) - Incorrectly thinks that both equations should maintain their original coefficients when added.

(C) - Assumes the coefficients from the two equations combine directly without consideration for matching terms.

(D) - nan
