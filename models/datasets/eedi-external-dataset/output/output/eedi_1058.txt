###
Question: A point, \( R \), has coordinates \( (4,-2) \). The point is reflected in the line \( y = 2 \). What are the new coordinates of point \( R \)?

###
Answers:
(A) - \( (4,2) \)

(B) - \( (4,-6) \)

(C) - \( (4,-2) \)

(D) - \( (2,-2) \)

###
Misconceptions:
(A) - Believes reflection in \( y = 2 \) results in the point moving to the top without changing the x-coordinate. 

(B) - Believes reflection in \( y = 2 \) moves the point downwards by the same distance it is above the line.

(C) - nan

(D) - Believes reflection involves changing both x and y coordinates incorrectly.
