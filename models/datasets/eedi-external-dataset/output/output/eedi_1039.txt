Question: The three vertices of a triangle are given as:
\((1, 2), (4, 6), (1, 6)\).

What are the coordinates of the fourth vertex if the triangle is to be completed as a rectangle?

###
Answers:
(A) - \( (4, 2) \)

(B) - \( (1, 8) \)

(C) - \( (4, 1) \)

(D) - \( (5, 6) \)

###
Misconceptions:
(A) - Does not understand the relationship between the triangle and the required rectangle.

(B) - Thinks vertices can be arbitrarily chosen without maintaining the rectangleâ€™s properties.

(C) - Miscalculates the y-coordinate based on the existing points.

(D) - Assumes any next point will complete the rectangle without considering the distances.
