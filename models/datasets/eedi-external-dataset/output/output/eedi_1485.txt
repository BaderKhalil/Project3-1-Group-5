Question: Sarah wants to calculate the distance between the points \( (4, -3) \) and \( (2, 5) \). She identifies them as: \( \begin{array}{rrrr}x_{1} & y_{1} & x_{2} & y_{2} \\ (4, & -3) & (2, & 5)\end{array} \) She intends to apply the formula: \( \sqrt{\left(x_{2}-x_{1}\right)^{2}+\left(y_{2}-y_{1}\right)^{2}} \) What does the first bracket evaluate to?

###
Answers:
(A) - \( (-2)^{2} \) 

(B) - \( (2)^{2} \) 

(C) - \( (6)^{2} \) 

(D) - \( (-6)^{2} \) 

###
Misconceptions:
(A) - Misunderstands how subtraction affects the sign of the result, thinking that it remains negative.

(B) - Incorrectly believes that subtracting a smaller positive number from a larger one will yield a negative result.

(C) - Assumes the distance calculation leads to a larger number than actually occurs, possibly confusing the coordinates.

(D) - Misapplies subtraction, not realizing that this does not directly represent the required operation in this situation.
