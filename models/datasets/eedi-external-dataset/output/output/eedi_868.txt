(A) - \( \begin{array}{c}64 + 20 = 84 \\ 84 + 9 = 93\end{array} \)

(B) - \( \begin{array}{c}64 + 20 = 84 \\ 84 + 9 = 93\end{array} \) 

(C) - \( \begin{array}{c}60 + 20 = 80 \\ 4 + 9 = 13 \\ 80 + 13 = 93\end{array} \) 

(D) - \( \begin{array}{c}4 + 9 = 13 \\ 60 + 13 = 73 \\ 73 + 20 = 93\end{array} \)
