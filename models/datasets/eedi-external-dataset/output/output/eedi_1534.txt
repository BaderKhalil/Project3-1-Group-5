Question: When solving this division problem, which digit should replace the question mark to ensure the quotient is correct? ![Division problem illustrated in a long-division format with dividend = 624, divisor = 4, and the quotient has a blank represented by a question mark.]() 

###
Answers:
(A) - \( 3 \) 

(B) - \( 6 \) 

(C) - \( 1 \) 

(D) - \( 2 \) 

###
Misconceptions:
(A) - A misunderstanding of how to divide two integers leads to misplacing which digit corresponds to the correct value of the quotient. 

(B) - Assuming that 6 can be a valid digit in the quotient regardless of the constraints of long division with this divisor. 

(C) - Assuming that 1 is high enough to account for the remainder in the division process. 

(D) - Believing that 2 does not reflect adequate subtraction in the long-division process.
