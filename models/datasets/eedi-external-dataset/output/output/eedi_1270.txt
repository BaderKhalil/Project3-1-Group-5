Question: If \( a=5.5 \) and \( b=3 \), what is the value of \( c \) when \( b = 2a - 3c \)?

###
Answers:
(A) - \( 5 \)

(B) - \( -5 \)

(C) - \( 4 \)

(D) - \( 2 \)

###
Misconceptions:
(A) - The student forgot to correctly isolate the variable \( c \) when simplifying the equation. 

(B) - The student incorrectly assumes the equation can be solved directly without rearranging and isolating \( c \).

(C) - The student may have miscalculated after substituting values and did not check their work thoroughly. 

(D) - The calculation for \( c \) was performed correctly, assuming there was a mistake in interpreting the coefficients.
