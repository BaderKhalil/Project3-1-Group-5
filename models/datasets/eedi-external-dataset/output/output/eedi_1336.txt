Question: Sarah and Jake are working on the following system of equations to eliminate \( x \):

\((1)\) \( 4x - 3y = 9 \)  
\((2)\) \( 2x + y = 5 \)  

Sarah thinks that multiplying equation \((1)\) by \(2\) and equation \((2)\) by \(4\) will allow them to eliminate \( x \). Jake believes that multiplying both equations by \(3\) is the solution.

Who is correct?

###
Answers:
(A) - Only Sarah 

(B) - Only Jake 

(C) - Both Sarah and Jake 

(D) - Neither is correct 

###
Misconceptions:
(A) - Underestimates the need for a consistent coefficient across both equations for elimination. 

(B) - Misunderstands how to correctly scale the equations for elimination purposes, thinking multiplying by \(3\) will align the coefficients of \(x\). 

(C) - Assumes that any multiplication will lead to a clear elimination opportunity without verifying the final coefficients.

(D) - Unknown to the elimination technique, believes both approaches are flawed without understanding the intentions behind them.
