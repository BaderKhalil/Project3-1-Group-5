Question: Solve 
\[
5(n - 2) < 3n + 6
\]

###
Answers:
(A) - \( n < 8 \) 

(B) - \( n < 10 \) 

(C) - \( n < 4 \) 

(D) - \( n < 6 \) 

###
Misconceptions:
(A) - Misunderstands the result of combining like terms, leading to an incorrect upper bound for \( n \).

(B) - Incorrectly adds extra terms instead of subtracting them appropriately while solving the inequality.

(C) - Believes that simplifying \( 5(n - 2) \) was done correctly but fails to recognize that it must be compared correctly with the \( 3n + 6 \) side.

(D) - Correctly solves the inequality but misinterprets the final solution.
