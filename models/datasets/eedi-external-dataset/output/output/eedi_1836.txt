Question: A box contains \( 5 \) blue marbles and \( 4 \) green marbles. If Tom randomly selects two marbles without replacement, what is the probability that both marbles are blue?

###
Answers:
(A) - \( \frac{20}{36} \)

(B) - \( \frac{10}{36} \) 

(C) - \( \frac{15}{36} \) 

(D) - \( \frac{8}{36} \)

###
Misconceptions:
(A) - Miscalculates the total outcomes when selecting multiple marbles without considering the reduction in options after the first selection.

(B) - Correct setup but incorrectly cancels the probabilities.

(C) - Computes the joint probability incorrectly by not accounting for the order of selection.

(D) - Incorrectly assumes both marbles can be selected independently and multiplies instead of considering the dependency.
