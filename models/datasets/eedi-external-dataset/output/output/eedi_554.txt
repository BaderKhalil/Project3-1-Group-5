Question: A line passes through the points (2, 3) and (6, 7). What is the slope \( \boldsymbol{m} \) of this line? 

###
Answers:
(A) \( \frac{1}{4} \)

(B) \( 1 \)

(C) \( \frac{1}{2} \)

(D) \( \frac{2}{3} \)

###
Misconceptions:
(A) - Miscalculates the change in y by mistakenly using approximate differences instead of precise values. 

(B) - Assumes that the line's rise must equal its run over the interval chosen without proper computation. 

(C) - Confuses slope with the y-intercept, calculating \( \frac{4}{2} \) as the value of the slope. 

(D) - Correctly computes the slope, but misinterprets the fractions leading to misrepresentation of the values involved.
