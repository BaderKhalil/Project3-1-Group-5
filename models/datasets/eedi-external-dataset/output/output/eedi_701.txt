Question: A train travels from Station A to Station B, covering a distance of \( 150 \) kilometers. It takes the train \( 2 \) hours to complete this journey. If the route changes to include an additional \( 30 \) kilometers to Station C, how long will it take the train to travel from Station A to Station C at the same speed? 

###
Answers:
(A) - \( 2.5 \) hours 

(B) - \( 2 \) hours 

(C) - \( 3 \) hours 

(D) - \( 1.5 \) hours 

###
Misconceptions:
(A) - Miscalculates total distance but remembers the speed remained the same 

(B) - Assumes the time does not change despite the increase in distance 

(C) - Calculates time for the total distance incorrectly or doesn't account for the speed 

(D) - Underestimates the total time required for the longer distance
