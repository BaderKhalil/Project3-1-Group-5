If there were \( 300 \) students in total, which of the following calculations would determine how many students chose the beach as their vacation destination? ![A pie chart divided into various sections, labelled with vacation choices. The section for Beach is 90 degrees, Mountain is 180 degrees, and City is 90 degrees. The section for Cruise is depicted with an angle of 0 degrees.]() 

###
Answers:
(A) - \( \frac{90}{300} \times 360 \) 

(B) - \( \frac{90}{360} \times 300 \) 

(C) - \( \frac{90}{90} \times 300 \) 

(D) - The chart lacks sufficient details to make this calculation 

###
Misconceptions:
(A) - Misunderstands the relationship between parts of the pie chart and their respective proportions to the whole 

(B) - nan 

(C) - Confuses because the angles add to the total number of students instead of focusing on the proportion to calculate the number of students 

(D) - Believes that more information is required to derive the number of students despite having adequate data
