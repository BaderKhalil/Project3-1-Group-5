###
Question: Sarah is trying to solve the equation \( r = 2s + 3 \) for \( s \). She believes the first step should be: \( s = \frac{r - 3}{2} \). Ben argues that the first step should be: \( r - 2 = 3s \). Who is correct?

###
Answers:
(A) - Only Sarah 

(B) - Only Ben 

(C) - Both Sarah and Ben 

(D) - Neither is correct 

###
Misconceptions:
(A) - nan 

(B) - Thinks that subtracting 2 should be done directly to \( r \) without considering how \( s \) is scaled in the original equation.

(C) - Thinks both forms show a correct initial method of solving for \( s \) while ignoring the arithmetic involved 

(D) - nan
