Question: ![A triangle with a base of 12 and height of 5, labelled with dimensions 12 and 5]() Which of the following calculations would correctly find the area of the triangle?

###
Answers:
(A) - \( \frac{1}{2} \times 12 \times 5 \)

(B) - \( 12 \times 5 \)

(C) - \( \frac{1}{2} \times (12 + 5) \)

(D) - \( \frac{1}{2} \times 12 + 5 \)

###
Misconceptions:
(A) - nan 

(B) - Fails to apply the formula for the area of a triangle and mistakenly uses the formula for the area of a rectangle.

(C) - Incorrectly assumes that the area can be calculated by averaging the base and height.

(D) - Misunderstands that the area of a triangle is found using multiplication involving both the base and height, rather than simply adding the two.
