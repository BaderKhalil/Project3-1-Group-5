###
Question: Sarah and James are analyzing two linear equations to determine if they can be easily combined. Sarah states these equations can be added directly:
\(
\begin{array}{l}
4x + 2y = 8 \\
4x - 3y = 2 
\end{array}
\) 
James argues that these equations need manipulation before they can be combined:
\(
\begin{array}{l}
4x + 2y = 8 \\
2x + 5y = 10 
\end{array}
\) 
Who is correct?

###
Answers:
(A) - Only Sarah 

(B) - Only James 

(C) - Both Sarah and James 

(D) - Neither is correct 

###
Misconceptions:
(A) - When combining linear equations, believes that coefficients of \(x\) must be the same in order to add them directly.

(B) - When combining linear equations, believes that the equations must have differing coefficients or terms manipulated to be in the same variable form for addition.

(C) - nan 

(D) - nan
