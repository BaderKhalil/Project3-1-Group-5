Question: The volume of a cylinder, \( V \), is given by the formula \( V = \pi r^2 h \). Rearrange this to make the radius, \( r \), the subject.

###
Answers:
(A) - \( r = \sqrt{\frac{V}{\pi h}} \)

(B) - \( r = \frac{V}{\pi h^2} \)

(C) - \( r = \sqrt{\frac{h}{\pi V}} \)

(D) - They are all incorrect 

###
Misconceptions:
(A) - Correctly understands the square root operation and the rearrangement, leading to the correct answer.

(B) - Misunderstands the placement of \( h \) in the denominator; thinks all terms should be divided equally.

(C) - Incorrectly assumes \( h \) should be inside the square root; confuses the relationship in the formula.

(D) - Believes that none of the answers are valid, indicating a misunderstanding of the formula rearrangement.
