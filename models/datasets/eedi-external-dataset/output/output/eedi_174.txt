Question: Which of the following equations does not represent a line parallel to \(y = -\frac{2}{3}x + 4\) ?

###
Answers:
(A) - \(y + 2 = -\frac{2}{3}(x - 6)\)

(B) - \(y = -\frac{2}{3}x + 1\)

(C) - \(3y - 9 = 2x\)

(D) - \(y = -\frac{2}{3}(x + 5) + 4\)

###
Misconceptions:
(A) - Believes that the equation can be rewritten in slope-intercept form correctly preserves the slope.

(B) - Understands that lines need to have the same slope to be parallel, but fails to see that changing the y-intercept does not affect parallelism.

(C) - Thinks all equations can represent parallel lines regardless of the slope, miscalculating the slope when rewriting the equation.

(D) - Believes that using the point-slope form accurately gives the correct slope even if it is not compared correctly.
