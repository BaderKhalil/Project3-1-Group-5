Question: Aisha is analyzing the graph of the following piecewise function:
\(
y=\left\{\begin{array}{c}
5 \text { for } 0 \leq x<2 \\
Q \text { for } 2 \leq x<5 \\
1.5 \text { for } 5 \leq x<8
\end{array}\right.
\)

What are the values of \( P \) and \( Q \)? ![The graph consists of three horizontal lines at heights 5, \( Q \), and 1.5 for their respective domains.]() 

###
Answers:
(A) - \( \begin{array}{c}P=2 \\ Q=3\end{array} \) 

(B) - \( \begin{array}{c}P=3 \\ Q=4\end{array} \) 

(C) - \( \begin{array}{l}P=4 \\ Q=2\end{array} \) 

(D) - \( \begin{array}{l}P=5 \\ Q=1\end{array} \) 

###
Misconceptions:
(A) - Assumes the value of \( Q \) should be below the highest value instead of correctly identifying it from the graph.

(B) - Incorrectly infers the heights from the graph, not taking into account the continuity of the function. 

(C) - Chooses \( Q \) based on the nearest marked value without accurately determining its height from the graph.

(D) - Incorrectly assumes the function continues to decrease and misreads the graph.
