Question: What should replace the square when these two brackets are expanded and simplified?
\(
(x+4)(x-3) \equiv x^{2} \triangle x \square
\) 

###
Answers:
(A) - \( \square=+12 \) 

(B) - \( \square=+1 \) 

(C) - \( \square=-12 \) 

(D) - \( \square=-7 \) 

###
Misconceptions:
(A) - Believes the constant in an expanded quadratic comes from multiplying the two numbers in the brackets. 

(B) - Misunderstands that the constant term is found by doing additive operations between the numbers in the brackets instead of multiplication. 

(C) - nan 

(D) - Believes to subtract numbers correctly without considering their signs during constant term calculation.
