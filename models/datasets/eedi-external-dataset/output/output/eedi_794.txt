If the probability of selecting a red marble is \( 0.6 \), what is the probability of selecting a blue marble?

###
Answers:
(A) - \( 0.3 \)

(B) - \( 0.4 \)

(C) - \( 0.5 \)

(D) - Impossible to know

###
Misconceptions:
(A) - Incorrectly assumes that the remaining probability can be divided equally among the remaining colors.

(B) - Miscalculates by adding probabilities instead of considering the total must equal 1.

(C) - Thinks that there can be more than one probability above 1 for the events since it adds to incorrect totals.

(D) - Understands that the total probability must sum to 1 but fails to account for the already known probabilities.
