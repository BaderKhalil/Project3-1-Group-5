Question: Which of the following represents the expression 
\(3x^{3}y\) correctly in expanded form?

###
Answers:
(A) - \(3 \times x \times x \times x \times y\) 

(B) - \(3 \times 3 \times x \times y\) 

(C) - \(3 \times x \times x \times y \times y\) 

(D) - \(x \times x \times x \times 3 \times y\) 

###
Misconceptions:
(A) - Correctly identifies the power but incorrectly states the coefficient structure. 

(B) - Conflates the coefficient with the exponent, incorrectly treating 3 as being squared. 

(C) - Misapplies the exponent to both the \(x\) and the \(y\). 

(D) - Adds the coefficient and variables incorrectly, but uses the right number of \(x\) terms.
