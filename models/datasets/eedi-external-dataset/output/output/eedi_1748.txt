Question: Which line best represents the reflection of shape \( R \) onto shape S? ![A coordinate grid with two trapezoids drawn, labelled R and S. R has the coordinates: (1,2) (3,2) (4,3) (0,3) and S has the coordinates: (4,5) (6,5) (7,6) (3,6).]() 

###
Answers:
(A) - \( y = 3.5 \) 

(B) - \( y = 2 \) 

(C) - \( y = -\frac{1}{2}x + 4 \) 

(D) - This is not a reflection 

###
Misconceptions:
(A) - nan 

(B) - Believes the reflection occurs along the shape itself rather than between the two shapes 

(C) - Misunderstands the slope of the line of reflection 

(D) - Believes reflections can only happen over horizontal or vertical lines
