Question: Consider the linear equation represented by the graph 
\(y = 3 + 0.5x\) ![A set of axes with y=3+0.5x drawn on.]() Use the graph to find the solution for 
\(3 + 0.5x = 0\) 

###
Answers:
(A) - \( x = -6 \) 

(B) - \( x = 0 \) 

(C) - \( x = 3 \) 

(D) - \( x = -3 \) 

###
Misconceptions:
(A) - nan 

(B) - Believes the solution of mx + c = 0 is x = 0 

(C) - Believes they can find the x-intercept by simply looking at the y-intercept 

(D) - Believes the solution of mx + c = 0 is found by taking the opposite of c
