###
Question: Which of the following equations represents a situation where the parabola opens downwards?

###
Answers:
(A) - \( y = -2x^2 + 4x - 1 \)

(B) - \( y = 3x^2 + 2x - 5 \)

(C) - \( y = 0.5x^2 - x + 2 \)

(D) - \( y = 4 - x^2 \)

###
Misconceptions:
(A) - n/a

(B) - Believes that the leading coefficient being positive indicates that the parabola opens downwards

(C) - Believes that a quadratic function can open upwards regardless of the coefficient's value

(D) - Thinks that a constant term affects the direction of the parabola's opening
