Question: What is the value of \( x \) in these simultaneous equations?
\(
\begin{array}{l}
4 x + 5 y = 21 \\
2 x + 3 y = 12
\end{array}
\) 

###
Answers:
(A) - \( x = 3 \) 

(B) - \( x = 0 \) 

(C) - \( x = 6 \) 

(D) - \( x = 5 \) 

###
Misconceptions:
(A) - nan 

(B) - Misunderstands the effect of scaling; thinks \( x \) will always be zero when no constants are present. 

(C) - Believes that doubling the values of \( y \) leads to doubling \( x \), unaware of the dependency in the equations. 

(D) - Incorrectly assumes that adding the results will give the value of \( x \) directly, misapplying the linear combination principle.
