Question: Jamie and Alex are trying to solve the following pair of simultaneous equations: \( \begin{array}{l}5x + 3y = 17 \\ 2x - y = 4\end{array} \) Jamie claims that if you multiply the second equation by 3, you can eliminate a variable by adding it to the first equation. Alex argues that you should multiply the first equation by 2 instead. Who is correct? 

###
Answers:
(A) - Only
Jamie 

(B) - Only
Alex 

(C) - Both Jamie and Alex 

(D) - Neither is correct 

###
Misconceptions:
(A) - Believes that the act of multiplying an equation by a constant allows for straightforward elimination when the coefficients are not aligned appropriately.

(B) - Thinks that simply multiplying any equation by a certain number will always allow for the elimination of a variable, regardless of the resultant coefficients.

(C) - Incorrectly assumes that both approaches can work regardless of the specific equations presented.

(D) - nan
