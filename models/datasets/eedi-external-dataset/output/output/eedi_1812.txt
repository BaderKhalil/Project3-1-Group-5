Question: Here are two points and their midpoint. What should replace the star? ![A set of axis showing all four quadrants. Two points are marked in a straight line with a positive gradient. One lilac circle marks a point in the 2nd quadrant and is labelled (2, 3). One red circle marks a point in the 1st quadrant and is labelled (4, 1). Another lilac circle marks a point in the 4th quadrant and is labelled (gold star icon, green triangle icon) as the coordinates are unknown.]()

Answers:
(A) - \(\color{gold}\bigstar\) = -2

(B) - \(\color{gold}\bigstar\) = 5

(C) - \(\color{gold}\bigstar\) = 1

(D) - \(\color{gold}\bigstar\) = 0

Misconceptions:
(A) - Incorrectly assumes that the midpoint can be calculated by simply averaging the x or y coordinates without considering the need to find the corresponding endpoint.

(B) - Believes that the other endpoint can be determined by simply adding the values of the coordinates already provided.

(C) - Assumes that the y-coordinate of the midpoint can be determined without proper calculation from the given points.

(D) - Assumes the midpoint calculation would yield zero without accounting for the end points' actual positions.
