Question: In triangle \( ABC \), if \( \angle A = 35^{\circ} \) and \( \angle B = 65^{\circ} \), what is the measure of \( \angle C \)? 

###
Answers:
(A) - \( 80^{\circ} \) 

(B) - \( 100^{\circ} \) 

(C) - \( 45^{\circ} \) 

(D) - \( 180^{\circ} \) 

###
Misconceptions:
(A) - Miscalculates the sum of angles in a triangle 

(B) - Incorrectly assumes the angles can exceed \( 180^{\circ} \) 

(C) - Confuses internal angles with an incorrect understanding of angle addition 

(D) - Assumes the measure of angle \( C \) can be equal to the total sum of triangle angles instead of calculating it
