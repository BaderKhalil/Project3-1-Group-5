Question: Step \( 1 \)

Which is the correct next step rearrangement of the following formula, making \( x \) the subject?
\[
4x + 5 = 2(3 - x)
\]

###
Answers:
(A) - \( x = \frac{1}{2} \)

(B) - \( x = 1 - \frac{5}{4} \)

(C) - \( x = \frac{6 - 5}{6} \)

(D) - \( x = 1 - 3 \)

###
Misconceptions:
(A) - Incorrectly simplifies the equation by ignoring the variable on one side

(B) - Miscalculates the rearrangement by incorrectly handling the constants

(C) - Misunderstands the distribution leading to an incorrect formulation

(D) - Misunderstands the process of isolating the variable and jumps to a conclusion without proper rearrangement
