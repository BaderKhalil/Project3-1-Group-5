Question: The area of this rectangle is \( 60 \mathrm{~cm}^{2} \). If the width is \( 5 \mathrm{~cm} \), what is the length, \( l \), of the rectangle? ![Rectangle with a width of 5 cm]()

###
Answers:
(A) - \( l = 12 \mathrm{~cm} \) 

(B) - \( l = 15 \mathrm{~cm} \) 

(C) - \( l = 10 \mathrm{~cm} \) 

(D) - \( l = 5 \mathrm{~cm} \) 

###
Misconceptions:
(A) - Incorrectly applies the area formula and adds the width instead of multiplying it. 

(B) - Forgets to use the area formula; mistakenly believes that the area is the product of the width and length without setting it equal to the given area. 

(C) - nan 

(D) - Incorrectly assumes that the length is the same as the width, showing a misunderstanding of dimensions in a rectangle.
