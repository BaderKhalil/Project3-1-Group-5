Question: ![A solid red square (4 sided polygon with all 4 sides of equal length).]() What is the order of rotational symmetry of this square?

###
Answers:
(A) - \( 0 \)

(B) - \( 2 \)

(C) - \( 3 \)

(D) - \( 4 \)

###
Misconceptions:
(A) - Believes that rotational symmetry only counts if the shape appears unchanged at one specific rotation

(B) - Does not know how to determine the number of distinct rotations that map the shape onto itself

(C) - Counts the total angles of rotation without realizing that each distinct angle represents a unique rotation

(D) - nan
