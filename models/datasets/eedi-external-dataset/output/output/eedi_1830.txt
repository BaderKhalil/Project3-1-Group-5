        Answers:
        (A) - Same-side interior 

        (B) - Vertical 

        (C) - Alternate interior 

        (D) - Complementary 

        ###
        Misconceptions:
        (A) - Confuses same-side interior angles with alternate angles 

        (B) - May falsely assume that vertical angles are related to same-side angles 

        (C) - Confuses alternate interior with alternate exterior angles 

        (D) - Believes complementary angles must be formed by perpendicular lines
