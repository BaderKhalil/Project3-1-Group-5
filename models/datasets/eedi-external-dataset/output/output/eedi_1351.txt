Question: Solve the equation:
\[
4q - 8 = 12
\] 

###
Answers:
(A) - \( q = 5 \) 

(B) - \( q = 2 \) 

(C) - \( q = 3 \) 

(D) - \( q = 8 \) 

###
Misconceptions:
(A) - When solving, adds 8 to both sides and incorrectly interprets the result. 

(B) - Correctly adds 8 to isolate \( 4q \) but incorrectly divides by 2 instead of 4. 

(C) - Misunderstands the division operation, not recognizing the correct divisor was 4. 

(D) - Incorrectly assumes that adding 8 gives the answer directly without further division.
