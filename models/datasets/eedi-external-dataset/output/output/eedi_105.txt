Question: What is the measure of angle \( x \) ? ![Three lines intersecting. At the center of the image, two lines intersect and one of them is extended, forming two angles: 75 degrees and \( x \). The other angle adjacent to the extended line is marked 105 degrees.]()

###
Answers:
(A) - \( 75^{\circ} \)

(B) - \( 105^{\circ} \)

(C) - \( 15^{\circ} \)

(D) - Not enough information 

###
Misconceptions:
(A) - Student confuses vertically opposite angles with adjacent angles 

(B) - Student mistakenly believes that the sum of the angles around a point must equal 180 degrees 

(C) - Student incorrectly calculates the missing angle as a direct subtraction from 180 degrees without consideration of adjacent angles 

(D) - Does not realize that the angles formed at the intersection have a specific relationship
