Question: What is the measure of angle \( x \) in the triangle? ![A triangle with two labelled interior angles. One angle is 70 degrees. One angle is x degrees. The third angle has no label.]() 

###
Answers:
(A) - \( 70\degree \) 

(B) - \( 40\degree \) 

(C) - \( 120\degree \) 

(D) - Not enough information 

###
Misconceptions:
(A) - Incorrectly assumes that an angle must be the same value as another labeled angle in the triangle 

(B) - Miscalculates the remaining angle based on an incorrect sum of angles in a triangle 

(C) - Assumes that triangles can have angles larger than 90 degrees while still being scalene 

(D) - nan
