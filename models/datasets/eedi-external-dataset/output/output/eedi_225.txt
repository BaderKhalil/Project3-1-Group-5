Question: The ratio of apples to oranges in a fruit basket is \( 3: 4 \). If there are \( \mathbf{36} \) apples, how many fruits (apples and oranges) are there in total?

###
Answers:
(A) - \( 72 \) 

(B) - \( 60 \) 

(C) - \( 108 \) 

(D) - \( 45 \) 

###
Misconceptions:
(A) - Thinks that the total is simply \( 36 \) multiplied by the total parts of the ratio without considering the number of apples.

(B) - Thinks that the ratio proportion was misunderstood, resulting in the wrong total count of fruits.

(C) - Thinks that oranges were counted incorrectly in excess of the actual ratio, inflating the total.

(D) - Incorrectly assumes fewer fruits are represented due to misunderstanding the ratios involved.
