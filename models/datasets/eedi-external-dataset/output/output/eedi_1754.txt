Question: A cyclist's speed-time graph is provided below.

Which of the following estimates the total distance traveled between \( 5 \) and \( 9 \) minutes? ![A graph showing time in minutes on the x-axis and speed in kilometers per hour on the y-axis. The curve passes through the points (5,10) and (9,30)]()

###
Answers:
(A) - \( 40 km \)

(B) - \( 60 km \)

(C) - \( 20 km \)

(D) - \( 60 km \)

###
Misconceptions:
(A) - Believes that the area under the curve can be simply calculated using only the endpoints without considering the varying speed.

(B) - Misunderstands that the area calculation should take into account the average speed rather than just using the maximum value.

(C) - Incorrectly assumes that the distance is the average of the two speeds multiplied by time, overlooking the actual area calculation.

(D) - nan
