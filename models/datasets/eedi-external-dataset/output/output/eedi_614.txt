Question: Use the graph to approximate the solution to \( x^{2} \geq 4 \) ![A set of axes with the quadratic graph y=x^2 drawn on.]() 

###
Answers:
(A) - \( -2<x<2 \)

(B) - \( x \leq -2 \text{ or } x \geq 2 \)

(C) - \( x < -2 \text{ or } x > 2 \)

(D) - \( x > 2 \) 

###
Misconceptions:
(A) - Incorrectly selects the interval where the quadratic is less than 4 instead of greater than or equal to 4 

(B) - Correctly identifies the boundary points where the quadratic equals 4, satisfying the inequality \( x^2 \geq 4 \)

(C) - Selects points where the quadratic is less than or equal to 4 rather than greater than or equal 

(D) - Ignores the negative solutions and only considers the positive side of the parabola
