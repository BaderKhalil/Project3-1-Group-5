###
Answers:
(A) - \(y=3x-4\) 

(B) - \(y=-3x+1\) 

(C) - \(y=\frac{1}{3}x+5\) 

(D) - \(y=3x+1\) 

###
Misconceptions:
(A) - Thinks that the lines have the same slope and therefore are parallel 

(B) - Thinks that the negative slope means it is parallel 

(C) - Thinks that a slope of \(\frac{1}{3}\) indicates parallelism 

(D) - Correctly identifies the same slope indicates parallelism
