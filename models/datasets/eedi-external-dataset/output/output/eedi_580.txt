        Question: Lucy and Mark are trying to find the product of \( 72 \times 5 \) using mental math strategies. 
Lucy decides to calculate \( 70 \times 5 \) and then adds \( 10 \) to her answer. 
Mark chooses to compute \( 75 \times 5 \) and then subtracts \( 15 \) from the result. 
Who arrives at the correct answer? 

        ###

        Misconceptions:
        (A) - Believes that her compensation method does not yield the correct result for the actual multiplication. 

        (B) - Incorrectly assumes that adjusting \( 75 \) to get \( 72 \) will lead to an accurate result after subtracting \( 15 \). 

        (C) - nan 

        (D) - nan
