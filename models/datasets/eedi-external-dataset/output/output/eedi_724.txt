Question: A rectangle is reflected in the dashed line. What are the new coordinates of point \( Q \) after the reflection? ![A set of axes: x-axis from -2 to 6, y-axis from -2 to 5. A rectangle is defined with corners at (2, 4), (4, 4), (4, 2), and (2, 2). Point (4, 4) is labelled with the letter "Q". The line y=3 is shown with a purple dashed line.]

Answers:
(A) - \( (4,4) \) 

(B) - \( (4,2) \) 

(C) - \( (4,6) \) 

(D) - \( (4,0) \) 

###
Misconceptions:
(A) - Fails to reflect across mirror line 

(B) - Fails to reflect across mirror line 

(C) - Incorrectly calculates the new y-coordinate outside of the relevant area 

(D) - Incorrectly calculates the new y-coordinate, ignoring the extension of the reflection
